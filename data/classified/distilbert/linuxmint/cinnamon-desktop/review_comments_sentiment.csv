166664077,98,Salamandar,2018-02-07T16:01:30Z,"not really, no. i even waited for meson to implement this feature. that's compiler-level, it passes `-wl,--whole-archive` to the linker. it's needed to expose archive symbols in the shared libraries dynamic symbol table. by the way, meson is a really young project with really fast changes. 0.40 was an important release, you can't really *not* ship it with lmde3.",1,0.6690521240234375
