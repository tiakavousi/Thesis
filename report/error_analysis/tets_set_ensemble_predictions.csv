hi shengtao you would think if you follow: 1. check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. then add a bindingtemplate. then you would not be overwriting a bindingtemplates. you are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingtemplates if they are there. the current behavior is how the uddi v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec. please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues. --kurt,1,1,0.9237299561500548,1,0.8302337527275085,1,0.9182400703430176,1

if you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image (or your custom object) array instead of putting it in a local variable. take a global variable use timer (i.e. settimeout ) to check if the din contains img tag with class . if it does not find any matching element (and image_cleaned is false ) then delete that array. then set . then remove timer (optional but better).,1,1,0.9838069677352904,1,0.9916542768478394,1,0.9929189085960388,1
