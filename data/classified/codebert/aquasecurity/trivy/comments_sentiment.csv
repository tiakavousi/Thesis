[a link] also, we can add another logic there to select the primary link for non cve-id. for example, if it starts with `rhsa-`, we can store the rhsa link like [a link] as the primary link. even if it is processed in the function, it is simpler to call the function once rather than three times in three places. i'm sorry i might be missing something. if i understand the benefit of the current model properly, i'll accept it.",0,0.6615476608276367

1698604879,5062,knqyf263,2023-08-30T06:59:36Z,there are two ways: 1. use the local database - build trivy db locally and move it to the cache directory (see the default value of `--cache-dir`) - note that metadata.json must be located next to the database as trivy tries to download the latest database if the last updated at is old 2. use your own repository - build trivy db and push it to your repository (e.g. ghcr.io/juan131/trivy-db) - pass the repository with `--db-repository`,0,0.9945898056030273

2344885970,7339,michael-a-shelton,2024-09-11T23:10:49Z,"i do not think rego solves my issue. rego is inherently hard to get engineers to learn, especially those who do not work with it regularly. it would be difficult to scale to some of our needs. for example, one chart has 200 ignore rules in the ignore file that we run, when using the granular control. this is a cncf oss chart and not our own. doing that in rego would be unwieldly and unfriendly to those not familiar with rego itself. that is one chart out of the 40-50 we're pushing. the config file approach is in line with other linters (which is essentially what the misconf is for us, here, for helm templating). it is important to us to try to avoid additional cognitive load on engineers, and staying to the same pattern of maintaining config that is the standard across most tools in the space is ideal. already managing linters for go, python, terraform, markdown, etc, it is a pattern that has no learning curve. i also think the ignorefile concept for misconf is inherently broken without the use of explicit lines. so, it is not so much a feature as it is a potential bugfix. for example; running the misconf scan against a template that has clusterroles. ksv048 flags over privileged cluster roles, however there is a need for the crud verbs on one of the admin roles. by simply adding ksv048 to the ignore file, it is now essentially disabling that rule for the admin role and other possibly read-only roles in the same file. this is a security risk. by stating we only want to ignore ksv048 for lines 9-14, it will still be enforced on the read-only clusterrole. we could split this into separate files for this scenario, however we have seen this same pattern a lot in upstream oss components and we try to avoid manipulating those and deviating from upstream. i realize the yaml ignorefile is experimental, but it is something we would like to use. the other alternative would be creating a rego wrapper and loading the yaml config ourselves and parsing it in rego, which i would like to avoid doing.",-1,0.9167792201042175

[code block] [code block] what is the difference for you? debugging rego can be difficult if it does not work as expected, but so is yaml. without reading the source code, it is impossible to understand how `.trivyignore.yaml` is processed. like said, i am not opposed to adding the feature if there is a good reason. i'm just trying to understand what is preventing you from using rego.",-1,0.5245009064674377
2346103531,7339,michael-a-shelton,2024-09-12T12:04:29Z,"it is managing code versus managing config. code has significantly more overhead with it in regards to tlm. it is also quite a bit more verbose and more prone to error. for a one off scenario, i agree the rego approach is fine. at scale and longevity is where issues may start popping up. opa v1 changes are an example here; this does not fit that syntax and would break when required/moved to it. also, if causemetadata or any part of that struct changes, all of the rego now becomes invalidated. one chart out of the many we work with has over 200 entries for an ignore file. id, start_line, end_line, statement. that is 800 lines, which is a lot in it's own right. however, moving that to rego now becomes 1200 lines (adding the lines for the ignore block and the spaces before/after). sure, we could write more advanced rego to eliminate duplication of ignore blocks per id and handle the sets of lines, but that gets back into managing and requiring engineers now to understand sets/comprehension etc in rego. let's now take that number and multiple it times the amount of charts we're managing of 40-50, and you see how quickly that becomes unmanageable. now, not every repo has 200 entries, but lets use that number and extrapolate... thats 48k lines of rego that now have to be managed. should a change to causemetadata struct happen, or the flip to opav1 syntax, a config file is abstracted away from those changes and would not require any uplift. the rego approach would require alterations to 48k lines of uplift.",0,0.9260402917861938
2346282122,7339,knqyf263,2024-09-12T13:26:30Z,"this sounds like the opposite argument to me. as the operation scales, yaml becomes inadequate, and more flexible filtering is needed. this is actually what we have seen over the years. a comparison with regard to the line number would help the transition to rego more, although i don't think it is meaningful. as you also mentioned, rules can be written in short as follows. [code block] if there are 200 rules, yaml will result in 800 lines, whereas rego will only require 210 lines. if there are 50 repositories, with yaml it is 40k lines, but with rego it is about 10k lines. however, again, a comparison of line numbers doesn't make sense to me. opa v1 changes make sense, but it can also happen in trivy's ignorefile. as you probably know, trivy used to have `.trivyignore`, but needed to introduce `.trivyignore.yaml` for more flexibility. furthermore, `.trivyignore.yaml` is still an experimental feature that is subject to breaking changes. we try to minimize such change, but sometimes it is unavoidable. it may not be correct to assume that a change in `.trivyignore.yaml` is less disruptive than one in rego. i assume that opa is not yet stable as it is below v1, which is why breaking changes will be made at the time of becoming v1, but it is expected to be stable after reaching v1. also, for migration to the new syntax, [migration methods are supported]([a link] ) at language level, such as `opa fmt --refactor-local-variables`. if changes are made to `.trivyignore.yaml`, it is difficult to provide such functionality. in conclusion, our policy is to recommend rego for more advanced filtering and implement it in `.trivyignore.yaml` for the basic filtering that most people need. otherwise, we end up implementing very complex logic in `.trivyignore.yaml`. should know more about how much need there is, so i'd defer to him.",0,0.9689833521842957
