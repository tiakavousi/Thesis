Regarding the topics in the top comment:

> Incremental rehashing

I think your solution looks good.

> dbRandomKey

I think it needs to be more fair. I have commented on the diff.

> scan API

See comment on the diff.

> Avoid calculating hash every time

Yes I think we need to do this, at least for checking if it affects performance. A simple way could be to cache the last computed hash inside hashKeySlot itself:

```C
unsigned int keyHashSlot(char *key, int keylen) {
    static char *lastkey = NULL;
    static int lastslot = 0;
    if (key == lastkey) return lastslot;
    lastkey = key;
    /* ... compute the slot ... */
    lastslot = slot;
    return slot;
}
```

> Skip slots that aren't owned during iteration. In this implementation I've decided for simplicity, to always allocate an array of 16k dicts in the main dictionary, this results in a bit of extra memory as well as makes iteration over all dictionaries slightly slower.

For simplicity, I like that we have all the dicts allocated, but if we use an array of dict structs (see also comment in the diff) instead of an array of dict pointers, we probably get a bit faster as there are less pointers to follow thus less memory accesses."

i added a few comments with minor questions and suggestions for improvements.
after that, and the other pending comments (about expires dict?), i suppose we can proceed.
thanks."

I started reviewing the PR, and also edited the PR top comment to make it clearer (please check if it looks right).
So far i reviewed just parts of it (namely all the files excluding aof.c and the tests).
I.d like to post my comments for discussion before i proceed with the other parts, to see if we agree on things, or maybe i have a misunderstanding."

The two main concerns I have are these:
* Things being more complex for users who wish to backup or migrate AOF files around, and in particular failing to copy the right files.
* Upgrade path.

One way to address the first concern, that came up in the past, is to treat the `appendfilename` as a name of a directory we create (under `dir`) and place all files there. Users then basically have to backup or transfer the **entire** directory. Any down sides to that?

Regarding the upgrade path, the most common scenario I consider is where the user simply replaces `redis-server`, restarts and expects everything to work. If we simply treat `appendfilename` as a prefix we'd be creating AOF data that existing scripts/tools/etc. may not be aware of and silently fail to handle. Worse, if the old `appendonly.aof` is still there it could later be used to restore stale data.

To address that, we should probably rename the old-style file pointed by `appendfilename` to the new-style structure (as a base).

Another issue is that unless the configuration parameter is changed, we'd end up with something like `appendonly.aof.25.aof` which would be weird. Here, the above proposal to use a dedicated directly might help - because `appendonly.aof` would still exist but become a directory instead of a single file."

834071770,9788,oranagra,2021-12-16T20:31:15Z,COMMENTED,"here's some feedback (maybe i'm reviewing an intermediate commit).

I was under the impression that we decided to start by adding a separate config for the folder name, and use the old config as both a way to locate the old file on upgrades, and maybe also use it as a pattern for the file names we create inside the dir.

i.e. agreed with you that this is cleaner than using the old config as a folder name.
i was afraid of some edge cases with this approach that we should look into and try to resolve.
or actually if we use the old config as a pattern for the files we create in the folder, maybe there's no problem.

did you reach some new conclusion on the matter which caused you to go with the approach of using the old config only?"

1127641614,11012,oranagra,2022-10-02T14:48:15Z,COMMENTED,"Thanks Ran. this area needed some cleanup.
in fact, we could rename it to be part of the ""sort out the mess"" series :smile: 
FYI: #11310 (not sure which one to merge first)
CC @guybe7 

there is a ton of deleted code here, it's impossible to make sure it didn't have any specific logic for blocked command edge cases that's missing from the actual commands.
i just hope we have enough tests to spot these.
CC @enjoy-binbin @guybe7 maybe you can spot something."

i skimmed though the code again (not a real review) and added a few minor comments.
please make sure the top comment is updated with all the important details people may wanna know without reading the code.

i wonder if we should do something to benchmark any performance regressions from this
@filipecosta90 maybe you have an idea?
i.e. create a scenario where the benchmark keeps creating a mass of blocked clients and releasing them and compare the performance to the old code."

the two important aspects are maybe:
1. terminology: maybe if we'll call the non-ziplist nodes ""plain"" instead of ""none"" it'll be easier to refer to them anywhere in the code.
2. i feel that we didn't handle compressed nodes correctly, not sure how well this is covered by the tests."

since it was a diff between two commits i didn't see the older comments still pending, so i may have commented on something that's already commented.

please go over all the existing comments, if they're already solved, mark them as resolved.
if you have two discussions on the same topic you can add cross-reference links and resolve one, or resolve them when they're done."

> A config rewrite will rewrite all module configurations to the .conf file. Presently, there is no way to make assumptions about default values, so they are ALWAYS written on a config rewrite.

Not in favor of that. The problem is we lose track of explicit config vs default config, which tends to become an issue over time when defaults change. Is there a problem to expose something similar to what Redis already does, and let the module control if a value is to be rewritten or not?

> Alternatives to the ApplyConfigs() API is to call the setCallback immediately after the config is registered, this was rejected because you might have dependencies between config values, and it might be useful to load them all together first.

I very briefly proposed an alternative. I am sure we need to support multi-param set as a basic feature of the API. Possibly, also support both push and pull (where pull is done by the module at `OnLoad` time).

1. a few more flags we could expose (like PERCENT_CONFIG)
2. improved enums configs (not relying on implicit int values).
3. improved apply callback that takes a RedisModuleCtx and / or privdata

I posted quite a few comments about the implementation, but most importantly there's a lot of logic copied from config.c into module.c, and i think we could maybe find a way to avoid that (see my comments in parseAndSetNumericConfig).

so maybe we need to look into a POC for that approach before dealing with the test of the comments?

p.s. haven't reviewed the test code."

I reviewed the code, without the tests for now and added many comments.

Here are a few top level notes (**each also has a thread of it's own in the comments, but i wanna draw the attention to these first**):

* The review took long and it could be that some comments are duplicates.
* I think that before merging this we better refactor replication.c into two files (master related code and replica related code, i'll discuss this with the core team.
* I think we should change the state machine / connection sequence to a different way to do capability exchange and fallback to old mechanism without a reconnect.
* I think we're mixing several different aspects in REPLCONF that should be kept separate
* I feel that the two connections should be coupled in some way (redis will be aware that they're a pair). this could help us make sure the end-offset doesn't disappear from the backlock if it is small.
* i feel the terminology isn't consistent (rdb channel, vs second channel and so on), and that we need to decide on it and sort it out."

if you're gonna now work on it till completion, i'll need to re-review it from scratch sooner or later, but hopefully i'll do that after some terminology and comments cleanup, and maybe after any missing parts are complete (so that i don't have to repeat that again too many times)
please mark all the resolved comments as such, and if there are big ones that require design discussion and decisions, let's do that first, before reviewing and arguing about nonsense.

p.s. didn't look at the tests."

I did a quick review and gave a few comments, the main issue to be resolved is probably around the module API and complex modules with out of keyspace data.

Few other things i must note:
1. During loading redis is not highly responsive, it only processes events for a short period once in some 2mb of RDB data. so the clients working with the replica may get degraded performance, even beyond the fact that the CPU is heavily invested in loading.
2. I think we wanna have that mode enabled only when a replica was previously in sync with a master (not depending on whatever the database was empty or not though), when a new replica comes up, we'll want to avoid using swapdb, so that we **will** respond with -LOADING."

tests look fine, but i'd like to see if we can find a way to make them run shorter (not wait for slow replication completion), and share code.

p.s. this is that last thing to handle right? all other comments are addressed?
please go over the ones not yet resolved, make sure they're handles and resolve them.
also make sure the top comment is updated with what was done, why and any other implications of the changes.
then i'll ask the core-team to approve and we can merge."

and also edited the top comment and filled in additional info (mainly the decision of async loading based on repl-id).
please take a look and fill additional info.

regarding the slotsToKey map, did we decide to leave it in server.c or make it opaque in cluster.c? (if we do that, the top comment needs another update, or just deletion of a line)

let's finish all the C code and documentation before we proceed with test cleanup, which we can do while others review the code."

I must say that i like the result despite the complexity it adds, i think it brings a lot of value.

i gave quite a lot of comment, possibly some were due to my misunderstanding of the roles of some fields (i began by reviewing server.h), which became clear later when i read the code that uses them, but still i think the documentation in the header and possibly some field names should be improved.

I also think i found one or two bugs, which indicates that we may need to improve the testing to cover these cases, and maybe also add some fuzzer to smoke out other edge cases not currently covered.

please go over the PR top comment and see if it needs any update.
i think it doesn't mention the rax used for quick psync offset finding (and the fact not all nodes are included).
and i think it doesn't mention the fact that now the actual backlog can be larger than the config setting if some replica is using large buffer (so psync will sometimes succeed with bigger gap)."

761692572,9166,yoav-steinberg,2021-09-23T10:10:07Z,COMMENTED,"I think there's an issue with the replication backlog being larger than the (slave) client output buffer limit. In such a case:
- If we disconnect a slave because of reaching obuf limit we don't gain anything, since we still keep all the memory for the backlog.
- Once that slave PSYNCs we'll set its obuf to a value which is larger than its max allowed obuf (instead of refusing the PSYNC), and then disconnect it for reaching its obuf limit. This might continue until the backlog buf is out of the PSYNC range.

If this is the case, we need to fix `checkClientOutputBufferLimits()` somehow so if we're checking for a slave then the limit will be `MAX(slave-limit, repl-backlog-limit)`.

Another related issue is that if trimming of the replication buffer is done in the background and not immediately then there might be a case where a slave is disconnected because of obuf limit and then tries a PSYNC and instead of failing (because we freed the repl buf) we still have it and we succeed the PSYNC only to fail again on an obuf limit. Makes sense? Is this relevant?"

We need to validate the behavior after failures when running redis-cli, since I think that is most of the users will be doing when they hit these failures. 

My biggest concern is that there are now two competing sources of truth of slot ownership, one driven out of the primaries through the clusterbus and one through the replication stream. I'm thinking that maybe we should trend towards a design where nodes within a shard learn their slot state from replication, and learn about other shards through gossip. I think you sort of implement a lot of this, but maybe it's just a mental model I need to wrap my head around."

741513212,9320,yossigo,2021-08-30T11:11:49Z,COMMENTED,"@pizhenwei I've started reviewing the code and made a few comments. My main input is we need to break down this PR into several phases to make it easier to handle.

I believe the first phase should be about connection API change/cleanup only - fully encapsulate `ConnectionType`, only use generic `connCreate`, `connAccept`, etc. Leave everything in `connection.c` to avoid big diffs due to code reorganization at this point.

At this point I'd also want to be sure we don't introduce any unexpected performance regressions.

The next stages would be --
* Add `tls-module-path` and the ability to *optionally* build TLS support separately (i.e. `BUILD_TLS=yes|no|ext`). Maybe at this point already consider a more generic `load-extension` mechanism (the term ""module"" is used for Redis Modules, we don't want to confuse the two).
* Consider if/how additional arbitrary connection types can be supported.
* Finalize code reorganization.

@oranagra Do you have any other/additional thoughts?"
1003594233,9320,oranagra,2022-06-13T12:25:05Z,COMMENTED,"@pizhenwei thank you for your patience, sorry it takes so long.
i wasn't part of the loop earlier and my review now is just through the peephole of the github diff, so i might be off or missing things.

i did review the commits in the PR one by one, and the refactoring work you did seem pretty solid (gave a few minor comments).

I also looked at a few commits at the top of https://github.com/pizhenwei/redis/commits/feature-rdma-v2 to see how you took it further and how RDMA and possibly other mediums can be integrated with minimal or no changes to redis, hoping for redis to be flexible enough to support various nuances and oddities each one brings.

I do remember you mentioned something about RDMA not being able to deliver a writable event, and i assume we might need to pull portions of ae.c into this extensions mechanism.

A few random notes about changes i see in the commits of that other branch:

refactory related:
* i don't think it's appropriate clientAcceptHandler (protected mode, error replies, module hooks, freeing clients, server stats) is in connection.c (should somehow move back to networking IMHO)
* same for acceptCommonHandler and clusterAcceptHandler
* i'm unsure about connSocketListenToPort. it seems a good fit for connection.c, but maybe we don't have to move it (unnecessary blamelog and review overhead).

general:
* maybe instead of ""burning"" the medium specific configs into redis, we should either use the new module api config system (#10285) to configure these.
  there are two ways we can do that:
  one is that these extensions can be both an extension, but also a module, and use the module API to register configs.
  the other is that maybe we'll extract the mechanism that allows modules to register configs (which are applied after config file parsing instead of during), in a way that the extensions will be able to use them too.
* maybe instead of the several hard coded `if`s in redis that init and setup (listen) the extensions, we can have a loop that handles all the loaded extensions, in which case instead of hard coded indexes to the connection type array, they'll be dynamic. i.e. each entry in the array has a pointer to the callback struct, but we don't know which index has which type (Socket and TLS may be an exception since we due to compatibility of previous state, we may have to refer to them by index)."

i see we can now pass arguments to the extension at load time, which is nice (p.s. i think you better re-add the section in redis.conf), so the need for an API to register CONFIG SET/GET interaction and runtime configs is arguably reduced (we should still do that some day later though IMHO)."

trying to conclude if all of these (config, cert, ctx, client ctx) are always gonna be TLS specific.
i guess it's almost certainly right about all except config.

regarding the config, what sets TLS different than Unix and Socket is that it has extra configs in addition to `bind` and `port`, which may also be true for other future extensions.
however, TLS has native redis configs, and other extensions are likely to use the module configuration infrastructure with it's apply callback."

During I developed this part, I realized that moving code in server.c may probably be problematic by myself. So could you please continue this part or give me any hint?

it's not that the sentinel timer is called before the listeners are initialized, it's that `tlsInit` used to be outside the `if (!server.sentinel_mode)`..`else` block, and now `initListeners` is inside (only executed for redis server case, and never for the sentinel case.
in fact, in order to support TLS as a loadable extension for sentinel, we now have to support modules in sentinel too, so we need to move the whole next block to before that `if`: 
```
        moduleInitModulesSystemLast();
        moduleLoadFromQueue();
        ACLLoadUsersAtStartup();
        initListeners();
```

the only other alternative is to decide we don't support loadable extensions for sentinel, just built in ones.

the conversation was too long for me to read, and the top comment is well.... missing!.
so i went in to read the code hiding / ignoring the current comments (made the code hard to read).

aside from responding to my comments, please also update the top comment, mark any resolved threads as resolved, and please `@` mention me again in the pending threads, trying to sum up the pending decision in case the thread is really long.

thank you."

* Documentation in Redis is in the `.c` files, not in the `.h` files.
* Hiredis already contains a reply parser. It's a simple protocol, so maybe there is not problem to have one more parser, but it can be considered if we want to improve/refactor/export the one in hiredis instead."

Do you want to update the top comment with everything you have in mind that's still pending? I imagine there's a long tail and maybe we can parallelize this work somehow."

please add a better top comment before we call others to take a look.
it should include some description of the purpose and design / decisions we already took.
you can maybe copy some from this [comment](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/9845#issuecomment-1009747180).

also, in order to better judge this, it would be nice to look at what the user facing documentation  is gonna look like, but maybe a detailed top comment can fill that place for now.

please also add some todo list which states the status of the task and the remaining issues (like completing the data for all commands, providing module API, and writing docs.)"

735736405,9406,oranagra,2021-08-23T06:22:04Z,COMMENTED,"only after reviewing, i realized that this completely misses the request of being able to access the value from that notification callback.
for that to work, the callback needs to be made in dbSyncDelete and dbAsyncDelete before the call for dictUnlink.
but on the other hand, we can't afford to do that if the key doesn't exist, so it seems we'll have to add an additional `dictFind` that's only used if there's some module subscribed to that event.

also, it's probably a good idea to add a test that shows that's working (RM_OpenKey getting the value)"

I've briefly read the discussion in the issue, and the compromises you made seem OK.
 
The one part that's not solved is the fact the request and some of the discussion was around tracking the full command processing + waiting time, and that's too complicated to handle. 
Considering the low impact of this PR on both complexity and performance, I suppose we can take it even if the value is not as high as we wished. 

Regarding the format, the only concern I have is what if we'll want to add more metrics in the future, like one that's including the blocked time for blocking commands. 
I.E. For normal command stats (total time) we can simply add more fields, but here if we wanna do that we need to add more sections. "

top comment is missing:
- the new COMMAND LIST
- mention renaming of the old allowed_subcommands and maybe some refactoring in acl.c extracting code to common functions
- maybe make a specific section about breaking changes (specifically commandstats IIRC)
- mention it's now possible to do things like +config|get|appendonly in ACL

other todo:
- need to update the acl topic in redis.io (both the categories and the sub-commands) - with some note about redis 7 and up

maybe add a TODO section in the top comment for that so we can track it's status later."

653606574,8887,oranagra,2021-05-06T16:52:01Z,COMMENTED,"@sundb thank you for that effort.

i've added a few comments inside the code, but here are some general ones:
1. i don't like the term ""list container"". in ""ziplist"" and ""listpack"", we mention it is zipped, or packed, i.e. encoded. this container can be more easily mistaken to be something related to list data type rather than an encoding type.
maybe a term like ""encoded list"" or ""packed list"" (i.e. something that is generic, and both ziplist and listpack comply to, i.e. both ziplist and listpack are encoded and packed).
2. currently we only create new hashes with listpack, and when modifying an existing hashes we'll always keep them as ziplists.
we need to see if we can come up with a plan to gradually convert them.
i.e. i don't want an O(N) operation at load time or any other time, but eventually i want them all gone.
3. we have a problem with testing. the majority of the tests work by creating a new db from scratch, so the ziplist code is now mostly unreachable.
maybe we need some DEBUG sub-command that will tell redis to default to creating ziplists, and then run the entire testsuite in that mode (in the daily CI)
i'm specifically worried about the corrupt-dump-fuzzer test. we either need to save an old rdb file in the assets folder, or let it run twice with that DEBUG tweak i suggested."

i assume they're mostly about deleting the common interface, reverting unnecessary changes (like all changes to ziplist.c/h and other complications we created when we considered a case were both can be present side by side at runtime).

regarding the new corrupt payload test you added, is it related to the new assertions in lpEntrySizeUnsafe? did the fuzzer found it?"

@redis/core-team Might be useful to take a look now while this is in the early draft stage for how this solves the cluster pubsub scaling problem. The interesting bit is that it's introduce 2 new commands publishlocal and subscribelocal, which exist in their own namespaces.

Full suggestion is here: https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8029"

I suppose subscribing to patterns is useful, specifically if the pattern includes a tag.

after ACL, i think we would better not leave the plaintext password on redis side, of course, `masterauth` must be plaintext, but this has also been complained about by users, so is it possible that we don't persist internal secret which has super permission?

besides, I noticed that you are using `//` comments instead of `/**/` comments. In the Redis core, we use `/**/`, the original commenting style of C language."

942023339,10536,zuiderkwast,2022-04-14T09:37:44Z,COMMENTED,"I like the idea in general.

Regarding the form `ip:port@cport,shard,hostname` (which is already a pretty strange format without shard), I have two incompatible suggestions:

1. Since every part so far uses a different separator (`:@,`), we could pick yet another separator for shard-id, for example `$` (looks like S for shard). Then, we could be able to parse these strings from 7.0 release candidates too (with hostname, without shard), so the format would be `ip:port@cport[$shard][,hostname]`.

2. Now might also be a good time to make this format future-proof in some way, so that more fields can be added without breaking old nodes and clients. For example, add an URI query string in the end `?shard=s98s98dus98du&something=foo&bla=bla` where unknown future keys can be safely ignored.

WDYT?"

I think `CLUSTER SHARDS` is a client-oriented command (as opposed to an administrative command), and I don't see clients' value in getting a shard-id. It may not do much harm, but I think it's an unnecessary long-term commitment to an implementation detail.

This point doesn't apply to `CLUSTER NODES`, which is more admin oriented.

772228425,9564,madolson,2021-10-14T06:23:29Z,COMMENTED,"My original thought was that the node name could be assigned by an admin, say use the EC2 instance ID or some type of container identifier. This isn't all that simpler, as we need to propagate it through the cluster. Having an identifier that is composed of the ip + port could work as a simpler version of a user defined hostname. We don't need to persist the IP + port based nodename to the nodes.conf file, since we can derive it dynamically. I still think the admin defined codename is more useful, but I think we could go either way. 

I also thought it would be useful to print the ""codename"" in the logs wherever we print the 40 character hex identifier, since that can be hard to retroactively identify. This can be implemented regardless of how the codename is implemented. "

959189076,10515,oranagra,2022-05-02T15:06:50Z,COMMENTED,"i think this approach of first tagging the arguments that are matched and then generating the hint for the reminder of the line based on these booleans is too limited.
for instance, if the last match is a token which should be followed by a mandatory argument, we're unable (and won't be able) to handle it properly.
for instance typing `SET key value EX` should have hinted either only `<seconds>`. or adding `[NX | XX] [GET]`, but currently it hints the `seconds` last and suggests you add NX after EX.
i'd argue that this is worse than the previous one which was easy to see that got broken and stopped responding)

here are a few examples i didn't like:

other lower priority thoughts that can be considered later:
* what exactly do we do now for older servers (i didn't bother to check yet).
* do we wanna re-generate help.h so that we can do fancy things even with older servers?

didn't review the code yet, but the testing it shows that everything is handled nicely.

the one thing i noticed and not sure about is that when redis-cli works with an old server, we still have the old matching logic.
i suppose that in order to improve that, we'll have to bundle something other than the plain old help.h.
not sure we wanna proceed in that direction."

It's a lot of code, but in general the hints helper code is relatively isolated so it doesn't really hurt complexity of the rest of the cli code. Since it's relatively isolated, I don't think we need to be too picky with the review of this code, as long as it works and the is well-tested. But maybe it can be moved to its own .c file?

I'm concerned about including commands.c in redis-cli.c and the macros for modifying the internals of commands.c here, it's not nicely structured. I have an idea, see comment."

501594406,6929,oranagra,2020-10-04T09:40:40Z,COMMENTED,"Hi. thanks for coding it.
I added some comments, but for the main one (how to propagate existing [B]RPOPLPUSH i'm not sure yet.

regarding your questions:
- i see no problem adding fields to blockingState struct
- the reason to add command function to the server struct is if we want to refer to them somewhere, by comparing a function pointer, rather than doing string compare on argv[0]. so that's not needed in this case.
- what you did with ""left"" and ""right"" string creation is ok (no leaks), the reason to create static objects is for efficiency. for instance instead of creating and destroying an ""OK"" string many times, we're re-using a static one. i think it makes sense to do that for ""left"" and ""right"" too.
- what you did with `rewriteClientCommandVector` obviously works, but personally i rather avoid it (may break some day). the other usages of `rewriteClientCommandVector` are currently all for propagation, and not for the initial command execution.
- i think we should keep the RPOPLPUSH tests (most are quick and will be able to cover some compatibility issue). i suppose the new tests you added a covering the code well enough too (with the exception of using the old command ""alias""). bottom line, i think what you did with the tests is enough."

502687028,6929,oranagra,2020-10-06T08:11:54Z,COMMENTED,"all looks good. the only thing that may be missing is maybe add a test to cover the propagation of BRPOPLPUSH and BLMOVE to AOF or Replicas.
i see replication.tcl has these two tests:
```
        test {BRPOPLPUSH replication, when blocking against empty list} {
        test {BRPOPLPUSH replication, list exists} {
```
i guess these can be improved to look at the command stats to check which command was executed on the replica.
and add similar tests for BLMOVE.

maybe move `proc cmdstat` from integration/introspection-2.tcl to support/util.tcl and use it in replication.tcl"

i.e. purpose, design, and most importantly interface changes and any unrelated changes.

the ones i listed during my review are these:
- new config
- explain the refactor of CLIENT_PENDING_READ and io_threads_op (why and how)
- c->pending_read_list_node
- evicted_clients stat in INFO
- new multi-mem in CLIENT LIST and CLIENT INFO, and also other existing client memory fields (previously untracked)
- pubsub_patterns and pubsub_channels and parts of client_tracking_prefixes memory tracked in the above
- CLIENT NO-EVICT sub-command
- CLIENT_CLOSE_ASAP handled in beforeNextClient rather than beforeSleep
- anything else i missed?

it's nice that the implementation attempts to make a small diff by repeatedly calling genRedisInfoString rather than modifying all the section checks in that function, but i think we have to go that way anyway since the current approach is limited.

another thing to consider is backwards compatibility, in the sense of what would happen if someone tries to call `INFO memory replication` on an older version of redis.
calling it with multiple arguments (or a single argument with spaces in it) will fail, so for many tools that manage redis servers and can't be sure which version they're talking to, using this feature is not an option."
806005453,6891,oranagra,2021-11-15T12:26:18Z,COMMENTED,"@hwware sorry about the delay.
i must say i don't like this approach.
the default sections are now defined in two places (both inside genRedisInfoString and in the list in infoCommand).

normally, it has two loops on all the arguments (in infoCommand), and then another loop on the dict it generates.
and it calls genRedisInfoString multiple times, each call ends up doing many string compares.

what's nice about your approach is that you managed to do it without a single change to genRedisInfoString, but i don't think that's a real concern.

what i imagine should be done instead, is pass the dict to genRedisInfoString (calling it only once), and change all the section checks in genRedisInfoString to use dictFind.

similar logic needs to be implemented in RM_InfoAddSection (i already designed the API with that feature of multiple sections in mind).

i think the two loops on `argc` can be unified into one, which will result in a dict and two boolean flags (`all` and `everything`, which will be passed to genRedisInfoString as argument along side the dict).

the list of `default` sections will be present only once in the source code (in infoCommand), and will be added to the dict in case no arguments are provided, or the term ""default"" was specified.

let me know what you think.

p.s. your current approach won't play nice with modules, since RM_InfoAddSection can include a certain section both by module name filter and section name filter (so there's a change the same section will appear twice if it is present in the dict twice)"

i didn't review the diff from last time (too much back and forth)
but rather re-read the diff of the current version vs unstable.
it's a little bit closer to what i suggested, but there are a few bugs, styling issues, and most importantly the handling of sentinel default sections and requested sections sanitization isn't what we agreed.

i assume all the old comments can be dismissed now (please go over them and dismiss them unless you notice some observation that was forgotten)

This is very useful.
please don't take my comments personally, i guess i'm emotional about the subject.

the 3 main topics we need to discuss to continue are:
1. if there were actual bugs this uncovered.
2. if the changes could impact performance (even on non-modern, realistic system)
3. just discuss compilers and interesting edge cases for the fun of it."

One last concern is if we conclude any of the fixes here really fixes a bug, we may want to backport it to older releases, 
there was a small insignificant leak in the CLI that i don't think we care for.
and some issue in sentinel for which i'm waiting for an analysis.
other than that i think all the changes will not have any actual impact on redis.
i would be happy if you can go over them and add notes to the top comment dividing them to groups according to type and impact.  "

It has not been used by Redis Cluster until now, and in other contexts it has been used as either a synonym to ""cluster node"", or (as used in this PR), to describe a master and set of replicas sharing the same slots. To avoid confusion, I think we should avoid that using it here."

766488201,9530,yossigo,2021-09-29T11:21:42Z,COMMENTED,"@madolson I had a quick look at the code (don't consider it a full review yet) and have a couple of small comments.
Some other thoughts/questions:

* You mention this is semi-breaking change, but IIUC if one enables hostnames and delivers extensions to old nodes they'll just be ignored resulting with inconsistent behavior but no other breakage - right?
* I think there's something a bit confusing about the way extensions are implemented. On one hand it's a generic mechanism with a packet-level flag and extensions count. On the other hand, extensions specifically extend the gossip section. Maybe we should consider going all the way to a more generic extensions mechanism?
* The argument for extensions vs. new commands is atomicity of updates, but IIUC that's not the case when a node joins - it will initially receive information about other nodes without hostnames, and only later have hostnames propagated to it directly from other nodes."

here's my initial review (didn't look at the tests yet).

there are a bunch of minor comments here, but also some critical ones about the efficiency (specifically of random picks in listpack, and about popping them out).

p.s. eventually, this PR top comment should include some benchmark that mentions both memory savings and also throughput / latency costs."

i suppose the iterator can also be useful for single ""get"", but maybe we wanna expose a specific easy to use API for that?

what about deletion?

if we put aside consumer groups, i suppose with the addition of an explicit ""read"" (if we chose to add it), and a ""del"" we got streams covered, right?"

And ""MULTI propagation of SCRIPT LOAD"" I made some tiny changes on this case, instead of removing it.

yes, i think that was the intention of that test.
i.e. these few commands are handled a bit differently when replicated, so we wanna try running them inside an EVAL, and then watch the replication stream (e.g. with `attach_to_replication_stream` and `assert_replication_stream`) to make sure they were propagated correctly."

yes, i think we can drop the check, it adds some code (which is good in generally) but is a bit overkill i think."

I want to better understand why we think the right approach here is storing functions in the RDB as opposed to storing them in the conf file or a separate file. I view functions more analogous to ACLs than keyspace data, that they are properties of the cluster and not necessarily specific to the RDB data. This is basically completely broken for workloads without persistence, like caching, which seems relevant. I would expect having a well defined mechanism outside of the RDB to exist.

Also are we fixing this? https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8478 for functions?"

There is an issue with `RedisModule_ACLCheckKeyPermissions`, which is going to be incompatible with the other ACL enhancements we plan.

In the future, ACL selectors will specify ""commands <C1,C2,...> on keys <K1,K2,...>"" so checking key permissions without specifying a command is undefined.

I think we can either add a command name argument or defer the decision and just avoid this function for now. Including an API function that is going to become obsolete (hopefully) before Redis 7 doesn't seem reasonable."

posted some minor suggestions for cleanups / comments.

i haven't been following this PR and the recent progress.
so i see now we have no cap of the maximum number of items in the cache (was some 1k or so).
instead, we have a cap for the minimum (32).

i suppose that not having a max limit is fine, since it doesn't really matter if we release them immediately, or shortly after.

but maybe the cron mechanism should be slightly smarter.
i.e. in case there's a burst of 1000 clients, and no use later. it'll take it 10 seconds to delete them, right?
and in case there's no more use of these at all, we're still left with the 32 forever.

maybe there could be some much smarter but yet simple algorithm instead?
one that watches the max re-used since the last cron (lowest value of `moduleTempClientCount`, and does some logarithmic release?

If we do that, we might not mind removing the lower cap of 32 too?
i.e. if we release just one per second, we don't care that after 32 seconds we're left with 0 (when we know they're completely unused).

i didn't try to think of such algorithm, but i imagine it could be a very simple formula."

This PR changes the propagation of expire times to replicas to always contains absolute times.
Additionally, it adds two new commands EXPIRETIME and PEXPIRETIME (to get absolute expire time of a key).

Besides that, i suppose this is all belongs to redis 7.0 (both the new commands and the refactory), i think we should merge it to unstable only once unstable moves away from 6.2.

i added a few comments about the implementation, but maybe we should first discuss the key features here.

as we've established, there are generally two groups of errors, ones that are handled in processCommand and ones that happen inside the command code itself.
do we intend to cover only the first group? or also the second?
If we intend to extend this feature to match other types of errors, it's probably wrong to do an if-else chain of calls to `strncmp`, and then a lookup in a dict (or an enum lookup into an array).
maybe we should have a rax in which we can search by prefix, and implicitly support all type of errors.

i think it would be nice to examine this feature after adding a few more errors as an example (like OOM, WRONGTYPE, NOSCRIPT, LOADING, BUSY, BUSYKEY.
one thing we'll soon discover is that many of these are being used with a simple addReply (so we don't even have them on our radar)."

In that case we could also avoid the text manipulation and RAX which could end up be a bit more efficient.

That said, I doubt that performance is really an issue here (@filipecosta90 you can probably verify that in a breeze). Everything else is a matter of personal taste and I don't feel that strongly about it - so +1."

maybe though some of this refactoring could have been left aside for another chance (like the `process` function which i'm not sure why you had to refactor).

additionally, if we already do so much work here, let's try to further improve.
specifically i feel some doc comments are still missing. "

1. is a configuration at all needed, i don't think so.
2. maybe FLUSHALL / FLUSHDB commands can implicitly use lazy free now (blocking the caller till done), even if ASYNC wasn't provided.
3. what happens with lazy-free-eviction? i think the hole concept of lazy-free in eviction is a huge bug, i'm not sure if we want to fix it, but we should access the impact of this change on it, and if it's negative, maybe we can prevent it from being active in that case."

i was aiming for just separating the `if` that decides which action to take, from the `if` that does the time tracking start/stop (like we do elsewhere).

what you did was to improve the blocking infra to support time tracking for all blocking, but the cost is that:
1. currently it's inaccurate
2. it's a bit odd to see other similar metrics (for defrag and oom) work completely different."

i'm in favor of this approach

I'd like that, but it'll be a breaking change, so i think we should skip it.

I don't think we should bother.

I personally think that we should allow String DMC reads (useful for huge string), but we should error (rather than corrupt memory), in case the string is not sds encoded, and document that in this case the module should resort to a non DMA read.

> Consider whether or not propagatePendingCommands is the right place to fire the post notifications callbacks.

I think it's right, until the day we want to allow propagating from a non-write keyspace notification (aka, key-miss), but i think that's probably an invalid use."

i added some comments about this extra timeout in two places. i think in one we can either double the user's timeout, or we don't need it at all, and in the other (the case you mentioned), i don't think we need the extra at all. (maybe i'm missing something)

> 2. Both nodes can end up as masters if the original master gives up after if it has sent the psync failover to the target replica. This seems like an edge case that should probably be handled, but isn't currently in this draft of the PR. 

First, let's add a test that covers this case.
Secondly, maybe that's an indication that the old master must never give up, it must wait for a reply from the replica (either success, error, or disconnection, and until it gets it, it'll wait forever).
@yossigo can you come up with another suggestion?

> 3. Related to a previous comment about protocol version. If the primary is on the latest version and the replica isn't, the primary will demote itself but fail to handoff, so there should be no harm. We should also never send failover in that field for any reason.

yes, this should not cause harm, i added a comment with a suggestion on how to test it.

> 4. Do we want a failover abort option? I think that was originally a concern, I'm not sure it's that necessary.

I don't think we need it, i was mainly worried about the fact no one can communicate with that server at all. But maybe any call to REPLICAOF (NO ONE, or otherwise) will should abort it?

> 5. The pause stays in place until the the full-transfer has started/psync has succeeded. This is the most defensive option, but could also unpause the moment we demote the master. 

Why not do the unpause earlier? if it's just paranoia, maybe we should get over it.
In practice, if we don't consider writable-replicas, then when the master is demoted, it is effectively in writes pause anyway, right?"

but we now have a complicated problem with lazy expire.
I suppose we can just keep the key (avoid deleting it) and report that it's missing.
Lazy expire will find it again after the pause is released.

some points from the CR that may get lost in the comments so i'll repeat them shortly:
1. we need to allow non-write commands like PING, CONFIG, but block EVAL
2. we need to prevent PFCOUNT from doing conversion and propagation.
3. we need to reflect the RO flag to RM_AvoidReplicaTraffic"

to prepare for that, please update the top comment to reflect all the changes, so it can be used as a commit comment.
the things i see that should be listed are:

- new CLIENT PAUSE WRITE command argument

- new flag to COMMAND command: ""can_replicate""

the only problem i could spot (which may not be an issue), is that when using help.h (on old server) we show the `since` field, but when using COMMAND DOCS (new server) we don't.
it's logical since when we use COMMAND DOCS we show only the ones actually supported.

I was meandering through some clients and I couldn't figure out where you would differentiate the read/write path. I thought about client side caching, but this doesn't give us enough introspection to use it for that case. It doesn't add a lot of overhead, but unclear why we want to maintain it.

I'm good with the change as long as we've thought through why we're sending extra information to clients."

we can match the old output of COMMAND to the new one and see that the legacy spec is ok.

but maybe there's something else we can do? by matching the output of GETKEYS to what this extracts?
i.e. write some test that implements what we expect a client to implement based on the specs, then somehow compare the result of that with GETKEYS on either a hard coded list of commands, or some fuzzer?"

1. i don't think we need to have separate metric for the expires dict and the main one, we can count them together in the same metric.
2. i'd like another metric to count the overhead of the rehashing (i.e. the total memory used by `ht[0]` in dicts that also have `ht[1]`)

Just realized that in test ""Redis can resize empty dict"" in other.tcl, it is assumed that memory stats shows only the overhead of non-empty DBs. But now all DBs' overhead is displayed and so we need to change the test.

i see the test passes, what do you mean?
the deletion of this?
```
        # Set a key to enable overhead display of db 0
        r set a b
```

or do you mean we need another way to distinguish between empty and non empty dicts?"

1424875181,11907,madolson,2023-05-12T17:04:51Z,APPROVED,Code looks good to me now. @redis/core-team Here is a relatively small extension to pubsub that makes it easier to figure out what clients are registered. This came out of an issue we saw in AWS were a user wasn't sure why pubsub was taking so long and they only had the raw counts and weren't sure which clients were listening. Please review.

1. As an administrative/debugging command, it is more aligned with what `CLIENT` does overall. If we consider it a more user-facing command, in many cases, exposing client names and IPs will be undesirable.
2. Anyone looking for more than just the IP/ID/Name will have to do `CLIENT LIST` anyway, so it might be a better overall experience to have it all in one invocation."

i may be out of context here, i thought this PR was only about moving code around to different files, and that all the concepts were already previously agreed on, and it was just about re-doing it quickly and merging it.

i didn't go over the list of commit comments, but if there are important details there (like new interfaces or new mechanisms, not just code shifts), please mention them in the top comment as well."

I think i've reviewed most of the code (excluding the tests).

i have many comments, but i guess the most important one to address to consider if both geohashGetDistanceIfInRectangle is considering the box inside the radius or the one bound is.
hope i'm not talking nonsense.. i didn't study the topic enough and i have to move on. hope you can dismiss my concerns one way or another."

can you tell me something about the tests coverage and what was your approach when creating them?
i.e. did you duplicate some of the GEORADIUS tests and changed them to use GEOSEARCH?

I see you attempted to cover some of the syntax errors, but did you also try to test some box specific points? (i.e. search for points that are outside a circle but inside a big that has similar ""radius"")?
or trying to create odd box shapes (non square ones)?"

other than that:
1. revert the additional ""del"" keyspace notification
2. and move all the ""dupXxxx"" functions to their respective C files. try to find the correct place in each C file for this kind of API (not part of the commands section), and make sure to give them the right prefix. please do this refactory in a separate commit, so it'll be easy to review actual changes.

I didn't get a chance to voice my opinion before. I totally agree with passing the key to `unlink`, but I don't think it's really necessary for `free_effort` (although not feeling strongly against it).

@madolson I think you have a valid argument here, but I think that however we turn it the API will still end up with extra coupling. Even if we expose `LAZYFREE_THRESHOLD` we still have this rigid contract that will be hard to break, and if we just let modules decide we lose all control. So, as none of the options is ideal I'd stick with this one which is simple. We do have to document it properly though."
