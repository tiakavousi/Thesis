851943150,331,CirnoT,2022-01-13T16:35:10Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,few changes proposed. overall okay and is stable and working. see my further comment for additional details on possible issues however.

861509978,338,DjLegolas,2022-01-24T21:43:22Z,COMMENTED,"added some comments from a quick review. in addition, i noticed that there are a lot of interface checks of `if is_ip(inter) or is_net_interface(inter)`. maybe create a new function to check both? just like `is_ip` itself"
864060461,338,cas--,2022-01-26T20:21:36Z,COMMENTED,"thanks for updating, nearly sorted"

121612214,181,cas--,2018-05-19T07:27:12Z,COMMENTED,this will be helpful thanks. to skip tests on windows see: [a link] there are too many duplicated entries in `tox` without any obvious reason. unless they do something different reuse the existing environments.
124816770,181,cas--,2018-05-31T14:18:13Z,COMMENTED,"looking good, needs a bit more tweaking"
21406427,138,cas--,2017-02-12T12:44:04Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,there is duplicated code in `_on_entry_proxy_host_paste_clipboard` that can easily be refactored out.
21832146,138,cas--,2017-02-14T18:56:50Z,COMMENTED,you can put the split method into deluge.ui.common
121705463,180,cas--,2018-05-21T08:36:24Z,COMMENTED,"if the glade designed makes a lot of extra changes, create a separate commit for those then another for your changes. i have pushed an update to develop for the prefs ui being re-saved by glade."
873254067,359,gazpachoking,2022-02-04T15:50:53Z,COMMENTED,"i haven't used mypy a lot, but i think it could be a good idea to enable it. my only hesitation would be if we start having to add a lot of extra cruft to make mypy understand stuff. (by cruft, i mean stuff that is useless to a human reader, not just making things slightly more verbose, which could be useful to humans) i added a few notes on stuff i changed to get mypy to pass on core.py. my biggest concern is how it complains about twisted reactor. if there was some way we could solve that for the whole project at once it would be great."
852365423,337,CirnoT,2022-01-14T00:03:54Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"in addition, adding this before we collect on `twisted` should solve our worries with plugins: [code block]"
135806101,196,cas--,2018-07-10T12:51:08Z,COMMENTED,impressed with the additional tests but not sure about extra test time. perhaps not run these by default
141004414,196,cas--,2018-07-27T07:05:52Z,COMMENTED,"for disabling renegotiation, is it a case of setting the context options `ssl_op_no_renegotiation` and `ssl3_flags_no_renegotiate_ciphers` as mentioned here: [a link] can the testssl package be removed from the code and downloaded by tox. the tests would also need to be skipped if testssl.sh is missing."
868296274,354,gazpachoking,2022-01-31T19:10:14Z,COMMENTED,"i know this is huge and hard to review, but i'm pretty sure everything is running and passing again on this version (including some extra stuff that wasn't working before.) it'd be nice to remove all the basetestcase tests, but i got tired of the really tedious work for now, and it isn't terrible. i left some comments on a few bits that i remembered might need discussion."
883737096,376,DjLegolas,2022-02-15T22:51:04Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"looks good. i looked into that ticket, but the issue is on the console side (getting the port as str, when the func expects int)."
887334411,376,cas--,2022-02-18T14:26:07Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,looks great but one breaking change made that needs fixed
135899417,201,cas--,2018-07-10T16:38:07Z,COMMENTED,looking good however has all original functionality been retained as i don't see anything for tls sni which was in the original code: [a link]
884801375,364,cas--,2022-02-16T16:28:22Z,COMMENTED,a few suggestions to make to both linux and win runs
171959330,224,cas--,2018-11-06T11:09:20Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"looks good, some minor changes this will be breaking change for develop and master (2.0b1) but should be ok, will just need to tell users to update :p"
594789329,306,DjLegolas,2021-02-20T22:10:12Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"thanks for this feature, looks cool! please fix the code formatting errors (from `lint`): 1. fix `import`s order 2. use only single-quote best way is to run the `tox` tests yourself. in addition, please change the commit message as it is too long for one line. something like: [code block]"
763600873,306,cas--,2021-09-25T16:35:18Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"looking much better, can we do some final linting cleanup. use `isort` to auto-fix the linting issues. i was just testing it out and wonder if this should be a user preference since without any way for the user to disable it might be annoying. you can search for the `gtkui_config['show_piecesbar']` preference to use as a guide to implementing it. ![a link]"
840098350,325,cas--,2021-12-26T16:41:45Z,COMMENTED,"if we are making wholesale changes, we can remove the following from all files: `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`"
430154014,296,cas--,2020-06-13T17:44:46Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"thanks for the updates, a few changes needed though"
871672669,355,cas--,2022-02-03T10:54:46Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,this seems to replace the hosts line entirely instead of just hiding the password
2269104286,462,cas--,2024-08-29T15:30:20Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"thanks for the pr, just need some minor refactoring to simplify use of opaque list slice and indexes and use non-legacy `emailmessage`"

137436555,202,cas--,2018-07-16T13:56:44Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"there is a performance penalty to supporting float but i guess it's not terrible and using timeit i can see that dropping `:d` from the formatting gains that time back ;) looking at the console code it points to a torrent status field being `float` rather than `int` and there are only three potential culprits `seeding_time`, `active_time` and `eta`. the first two are direct from libtorrent status so unlikely to be float but `eta` is calculated in `torrent.py`. so looing at the `get_eta` code i can see the issue where the float originates: [code block]"
242278521,240,cas--,2019-05-27T13:47:51Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"thanks for investigating this, i has been meaning to test with 1.2... i don't want to make it 1.2-only yet so can this pr be just those changes to fix running on 1.2 (with deprecated enabled)"
862197264,347,cas--,2022-01-25T12:16:08Z,APPROVED,"code looks good, if you could squash the commits and put the full url to ticket in the message that would be useful. i can merge it later in week, do you have access to deluge git repo? i setup a libera.chat irc channel but i don't have the bandwidth to be on irc. i know that discord is popular, if you think it might help then can try it out."
893338128,377,cas--,2022-02-25T07:17:37Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"looks good, just need to remove an unwanted assert"
1003604989,386,cas--,2022-06-12T12:19:05Z,COMMENTED,could you clarify what has changed with pyinstaller 5?
87406985,175,aresch,2018-01-09T03:59:43Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"i've left some comments that i hope are useful. for what it's worth, i'm doing things a bit differently with spritzle now (using wait_for_alerts aswell), you can see my approach with it here: [a link] maybe it gives you some different ideas too."
988508254,385,cas--,2022-05-28T12:00:24Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"thanks for reporting and suggesting a fix, i have provided some feedback to improve it"
989031567,385,cas--,2022-05-30T09:06:58Z,APPROVED,"thanks for patience with this, looks excellent :+1:"
15759830,139,cas--,2017-01-10T11:01:16Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"i was reading up, trying to understand the situation and seen mentioned several times using `withcredentials` which seems to get the browser to supply the cookie. is this something you have tried? also there is a very long pr about what i think is the same issue and non-cookie session id is discouraged: [a link]"
43318834,158,cas--,2017-06-11T12:53:28Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,this looks good and minor enough for 1.3 inclusion. if possible could you create a pr for `develop` branch as well? thanks
43320996,158,ratoaq2,2017-06-11T14:25:26Z,COMMENTED,i'll implement your changes after your feedback about __eq__ then i can open another pr in develop branch
2261375229,460,cas--,2024-08-26T19:46:56Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"this is a nice addition, just a few small changes"
175125029,226,doadin,2018-11-14T23:12:36Z,COMMENTED,seems to be issue with x86 more so than x64(pywin32)
892299224,380,cas--,2022-02-24T11:14:49Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,if we are adding a deluged user service then we should also add a deluge-web user service
1449485142,404,cas--,2023-05-29T17:40:32Z,COMMENTED,"looks good, just a few questions and suggestions"
4652473,112,cas--,2016-10-18T11:52:10Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,there are two separate issues but the commits are not distinct and need some description of changes. also the web test changes should be in a seperate commit. this will need backporting to 1.3 so a concise commit is more helpful to merge.
125608270,187,cas--,2018-06-04T14:52:19Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,"there are changes to listen_interface logic with no justification, it is a comma-separated list of ip port-pairs. there is no mention in libtorrent of otherwise. also the deliberate logic to not allow ip address for outgoing_interface (on non-windows) should not be removed!"
137261636,203,cas--,2018-07-15T10:38:34Z,COMMENTED,an excellent solution! :)
844658948,332,cas--,2022-01-05T14:26:51Z,CHANGES_REQUESTED,we can just replace with `message` attribute since `exception_msg` was removed with changes to rpc protocol: 9b812a4eec6205b98
