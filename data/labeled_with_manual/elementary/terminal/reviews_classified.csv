elementary/terminal,reviews,1703785760,742,this is mostly working - thanks! a couple of issues: - changing the default font with ` scroll` does not change settings because at the moment the terminal widget changes the font directly. you need to change the scroll handler to activate the relevant window action instead. - i suggest you split the `save_opened_terminals` function up so that you can change the zooms and uris settings independently to save unnecessary work being done.,1,1,1,0.9826924800872804,0.9848297238349916,0.9799405932426452,1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
elementary/terminal,reviews,1704740371,742,you seem to have repeated a lot of code in `save_open_terminals_with_zooms`? can you just call the split functions? adding another signal to the terminal widget is not the best solution - you can just activate the appropriate action in the scroll handler instead of calling `increment_size` and `decrement_size`. this can be done with code like `window.get_simple_action (mainwindow.action_zoom_font_in).activate (null);` (other examples of this pattern are already used in the code) i have made a couple of other comments inline.,0,0,0,0.9738070964813232,0.9922915101051332,0.9916724562644958,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

elementary/terminal,reviews,790761404,633,this only works as expected after changing the settings. this is because the settings still contain the alpha value until they are changed and these do not match the strings in code when constructing the color buttons - so the wrong color button appears active. one way round this is to test for the foreground color instead as that has not changed. also to move the test *after* you have connected the color-button clicked handlers so that the new background colors get written to settings. in the longer term it would be better to move to methodology like code where a named style-scheme is saved in settings rather than the actual colors.,0,0,0,0.98319673538208,0.9907842874526978,0.9895312786102296,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

elementary/terminal,reviews,338573835,446,"thanks for the contribution! this does the immediate job, but i have a couple of comments: * you should update the .desktop file ""new window"" action command line to use the new flag * the `get_last_window ()` function's name no longer reflects its actual action - it does not always return the last window, even if there is one. as it is a private function i think it would be safe enough to rename it and maybe pass the option as a parameter in case the function needs to be used to get the last window anyway. you could then create the new window in this function and return it instead of the callers having to test the result and then create a new window.",1,1,1,0.9851330518722534,0.9829133152961732,0.9874327778816224,1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
