1329,OrtuJIRA_test_2,well since you didn't respond to my request i finally did without and checked out what you did. first of all looking at cincludetransformer i have to say that i don't understand why it is doing its own caching. caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. if you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a source wrapper. in fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area. one unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! once by the pipeline itself and once by the cincludetransformer. now concerning your patch. i don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. the algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getvalidity() methods. if your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then that does not make much sense to me. since i really needed this functionality myself and i didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the cincludetransformer i implemented my own very basic includetransformer that does exactly what i need no more no less. i'll post it here if anyone want to use it. i also looked at the xincludetransformer to see if i could implement caching in that one instead. but it seems that the xincludetransformer reads included content from url objects instead of from source objects.,0

799,OrtuJIRA_test_1,"""i just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring lucene-4089 though i just used a map. the part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a map of codec """"parameters"""" that you set on iwc/ir. split divisor from """"don't load terms index"""". define these as constants where they belong. i got unhappy here in the """"splitting"""" part because i wanted the divisor part in termsindexreaderbase but that doesnt extend fieldsproducer (where i wanted the """"don't load"""" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the termsindexreaderbase... maybe we should fix that too? i think this confusing the way it is but i didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote} but i think maybe i was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an """"untyped"""" parameter i thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

656,OrtuJIRA_test_1,[~bikassaha] thanks for the heads-up bikas! this jira is not concerned with the tez integration for pig and is simply the abstraction in pig to allow for alternate executionengines in pig. but will certainly change this on the tez integration side of stuff. thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! i think everything looks good from my end. i can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. certain things may still need more work. for example outputstats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to postore which is a mr implementation construct. scriptstate/ppnl/jobstats may still need more abstraction (especially ppnl) and reworking to incorporate a new executionengine abstraction. i think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make. with regard to public methods that were changed i don't think most of them are a big deal besides as cheolsoo said the pigserver throwing pigexception. i never thought ioexception was a good exception to throw but i think reverting pigserver back to ioexception as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. the rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project. however the change from jobstats to mrjobstats while necessary (as each executionengine would have it's own type of jobstats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using jobstats. that i think is the most important thing to keep in mind. the task of making the ppnl and jobstats clearly tied to the executionengine should be thought through also.,1

1377,OrtuJIRA_test_2,truth is that the sheer size of cfstore (over 2k line) annoys me. i think this prove cfstore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. so i tried to make datatracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. and being able to have view not leak from datatracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. i'm not claiming it's perfect but i really don't think that cfstore is our most beautiful class in there and i do believe that datatracker improves this a bit. but there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. and if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine i'd move them back in cfstore and leak the view from datatracker. i would however be more reluctant to remove datatracker altogether and put the atomicreference in cfstore. because this would move all the cas related logic in cfstore and seriously there is already too much stuff in cfstore. my humble opinion though.,0

987,OrtuJIRA_test_1,yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql. preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on writablecomparables so that might be a problem). if these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly. i think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but i don't see how you can enforce it in any way. different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them. if you can't reuse the same comparator interface i can always implement my comparisons in another place but i already have two of them (one in the writablecomparable and one in the comparator). i don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. yes i agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table.,0

804,OrtuJIRA_test_1,from the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make uwe type it again ) the idea was to maybe replace ramdirectory by a âcloneâ¿ of mmapdirectory that uses large directbytebuffers outside the jvm heap. the current ramdirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 kb if you have a 50 gigabyte index in this ramdirectory your gc simply drives crazy â we investigated this several times for customers. ramdirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based mmapdir). also the locking on the ramfile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/â¦ which does heavily locking. in contrast mmapdir is completely lock-free! until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current ramdirectory is not useable for large indexes. thatâs a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. itâs currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new bytebuffer-based ramdir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or iocontext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer thatâs better than 8 kilobytes). also directbytebuffer helps to make gc happy as the ramdir is outside jvm heap..... ramdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. the problem is that mmapdir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. have you tried mmapdir for read access in comparison to ramdirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on os and if file data is in fs cache already). the new directory will simply mimic the mmapindexinput add mmapindexoutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (direct)bytebuffer (outside or inside jvm heap â both will be supported). this simplifies code a lot. the discussions about the limitations of crappy ramdirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. we did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). the whole âmessageâ¿ on the issue was that ramdirectory is a bad idea. the recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on linux/solaris and use mmapdir on top (for larger indexes). the mmap would then directly map the ram of the underlying tmpfs.....,0

699,OrtuJIRA_test_1,hi michael thank you for your answer. i thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. unfortunately. i agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and i guess attachstrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality. i started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. persistencecapable declares a public method to copy fields (pccopyfields(...)). unfortunately you can't use in attachstrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception invalidstateexception will be the result). my suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the statemanager check in pccopyfields (i don't see the need for this check). afterwards you can use pccopyfields in attachstrategy.persist by adding something like ... if (manager.getcopynew()) { int[] fields = new int[meta.getfields().length],1
