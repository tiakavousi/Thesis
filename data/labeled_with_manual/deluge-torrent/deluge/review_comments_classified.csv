( [a link] ) 1. don't verify listen_interfaces against a single ip, also listen_interfaces is ip and port so accept a port but strip it from the string in the ""is_ip"" function? 2. find a way to verify a interface instead of just a ip for the outgoing_interfaces. both are a comma-separated list of ips. listen also takes a port, outgoing also accepts in place of a ip a os interface.",0,-1,0,0.7546924352645874,0.6317951083183289,0.8460537791252136,0.0,accept,majority_agreement,2
