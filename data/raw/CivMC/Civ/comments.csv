Hmmm, try going to `Settings -> Tools -> Actions on Save` and basically unticking everything. You don't really want these things to happen unless it's your own project anyway, or the project's style is *strictly* enforced, otherwise you'll just get diff-hell :P"
2187888488,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-25T03:16:01Z,Never had any of them checked. I think it's that all the plugins have different styles and IntelliJ isn't sure what to stick to. Mostly it's that they use spaces vs. tabs for indentation or have different rules about line wrapping and whatnot. Even forcing it to not format .java files still has it make some changes for some reason (eg removing indents on empty lines is apparently not formatting).

Yeah, PseudoServer has the Minestom approach [of only adding what you need], whereas extending CraftServer would be the PaperMC approach [of disabling what you don't want]. PseudoServer was added back in the 1.16.4 days (before even the move to Gradle) to avoid spinning up a whole server (and figuring out where the server files should go and when they should be cleaned up) just to test some item stuff.

That could be the cause of some unintended plugin-load ordering, but it should NOT cause the error. JukeAlert is supposed to be a soft-dependency; ItemExchange is suppose to work even if JukeAlert isn't there.

The error is also completely baffling, it's a `NoClassDefFoundError`, which means a class is being used in a non-reflective manner (eg: an instance is being constructed with `new`), but the class isn't present.

The missing class is `LoggableAction`, right?. That by itself is bizarre because nothing in ItemExchange references `LoggableAction`: the class `ShopPurchaseAction` extends `LoggablePlayerAction` and *that* implements `LoggableAction`, so... why is the missing class `LoggableAction` and not `LoggablePlayerAction`? Those are both JukeAlert classes.

Also, `ShopPurchaseAction` is only interacted with in two places:

1. Inside a lambda that's registered as an action-factory to JukeAlert, something that only happens if JukeAlert is enabled.

2. Inside an event listener that's only registered if JukeAlert is enabled.

So how in the hell is this class being used?!"
1958263617,275,Protonull,2024-02-21T23:06:31Z,"Ohhhh, okay, just figured out what's happening: the action-factory lambda gets hoisted by javac into a sibling method:
![image](https://github.com/CivMC/Civ/assets/52572989/431a770f-5be8-4f62-a321-c1032d5b7e4d)

So when the class is evaluated, it finds the method and tries to evaluate its return type, LoggableAction, which isn't loaded. The only fix to this is to deliberately avoid the lambda-isation and turn it into a sibling class."

1. For when Kira gets added.

2.

Very little will change from Java's perspective, but it'll be all the better for any plugin that has Kotlin code and needs to use those utilities.

This PR Enables checks automatically to run on all PRs, which will run `gradle check`, and `yamllint` (errors currently ignored until we fix them all).

You can see the checks ran on this PR as a requirement before merging, taking 1 minute to ensure that the project builds, tests pass, and yaml files are formatted correctly (which will be more important especially when plugin config gets moved here). If we add code style checks and such to gradle, that will also be part of the check task

It also adds a workflow that comments with an easy link to the built artifact on the pr for testing, the output of which can be seen here: https://github.com/CivMC/CivModCore/pull/98#issuecomment-1849098604. Once this is merged that will start working, since the workflow needs to be on `main`"

Whereas, if combat loggers were implemented through patches (or mixins), you wouldn't need to create a duplicate entity.
