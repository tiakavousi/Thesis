 - Changing the default font with `<Control>scroll` does not change settings because at the moment the Terminal Widget changes the font directly.  You need to change the scroll handler to activate the relevant window action instead.

 - I suggest you split the `save_opened_terminals` function up so that you can change the zooms and uris settings independently to save unnecessary work being done. "

Adding another signal to the terminal widget is not the best solution - you can just activate the appropriate action in the scroll handler instead of calling `increment_size` and `decrement_size`.  This can be done with code like
`window.get_simple_action (MainWindow.ACTION_ZOOM_FONT_IN).activate (null);`  (other examples of this pattern are already used in the code)

I left some inline comments with some minor code cleanups and copy changes alignment etc.

I agree that the long combobox here is pretty unweildy. Perhaps instead of trying to include as many styles as we can find, it would be better to have some kind of import mechanism and stick with the same 3 default styles for now. Perhaps in the interest of getting this feature merged more quickly, we should reduce the scope of this branch to only supporting a single custom style and we can expand in later follow-up branches

I think a major interaction issue we have here is that if you ever switch away to another style, your custom style gets wiped. This seems like it would be pretty frustrating for someone who switches between styles. I imagine we should probably persist custom styles in gsettings. Maybe with a ""styles"" child schema, even if we only support saving one custom style for now

Yes I think we want to maintain the behavior of a style also setting the window chrome to dark or light. The quick style switcher should make it really easy to alternate between styles without having to fiddle with individual settings every time"

One other thing that I noticed is that the button is always sensitive regardless of whether a process is running or not. We probably want to make sure to set the button as insensitive unless there is a running process to terminate

Also, this seems like a place where we should use [Granite.AccelLabel](https://github.com/elementary/granite/blob/master/lib/Widgets/AccelLabel.vala) and provide the keyboard shorcut"

This is because the settings still contain the alpha value until they are changed and these do not match the strings in code when constructing the color buttons - so the wrong color button appears active.

One way round this is to test for the foreground color instead as that has not changed. Also to move the test *after* you have connected the color-button clicked handlers so that the new background colors get written to settings.

In the longer term it would be better to move to methodology like Code where a named style-scheme is saved in settings rather than the actual colors.

This does the immediate job, but I have a couple of comments:
* You should update the .desktop file ""New Window"" action command line to use the new flag
* The `get_last_window ()` function's name no longer reflects its actual action - it does not always return the last window, even if there is one.  As it is a private function I think it would be safe enough to rename it and maybe pass the option as a parameter in case the function needs to be used to get the last window anyway. You could then create the new window in this function and return it instead of the callers having to test the result and then create a new window."
