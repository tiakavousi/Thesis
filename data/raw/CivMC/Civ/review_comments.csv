1797337666,634,drekamor,2024-10-11T19:13:32Z,What's wrong?
1797338030,634,Protonull,2024-10-11T19:14:02Z,"If this class will only be used by the BuildLimits hack, it could be made an inner-class of the hack. That's just a personal preference though."
1797338822,634,drekamor,2024-10-11T19:15:01Z,SoundTech OK'ed this so :man_shrugging: 
1797340312,634,Protonull,2024-10-11T19:16:55Z,Just seems like an odd naming convention to have both camel and snake case. It's typical for getters in Java to use camel casing (eg: `setMinY`) or otherwise to have the field public if you want to retain the name.
1797343662,634,drekamor,2024-10-11T19:20:43Z,"Oh, I used `y_min` in the config so it just got carried over to the var names. Now that I look at it, it does feel a bit weird"
1797344436,634,Protonull,2024-10-11T19:21:45Z,Okay :+1: 
1797406899,634,awoo-civ,2024-10-11T20:42:10Z,"Yeah `setMinY` is correct, you never wanna make exceptions to name casing."

1797414896,634,awoo-civ,2024-10-11T20:53:44Z,`type` should ideally be an enum instead of a string.

1798527270,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:43:54Z,There doesn't seem to be a `type` other than altitude. Is this necessary?
1798529063,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:47:05Z,Hack configs already store if they are enabled (shouldEnable). The handling here is not really necessary.
1798529984,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:48:33Z,"You don't need to log if a hack is enabled or disabled, that's done already."
1798530257,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:48:58Z,Why LinkedHashMap here? Is insertion order important?
1798530665,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:49:41Z,are the setters necessary?

1798533014,634,Protonull,2024-10-13T19:53:45Z,This one actually is necessary: it's only BasicHack that registers itself as a listener upon `onEnable`
1798533714,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T19:54:56Z,goddamnit i hate hacks
1798534056,634,Protonull,2024-10-13T19:55:32Z,"Needs an `onDisable` override here to remove this listener, then the `if(!config.isEnabled()) return;` checks are not necessary since the event will only ever be called when the hack is enabled, because the listeners will only ever be registered upon hack enable."
1798548319,634,okx-code,2024-10-13T20:20:00Z,Why?
1798548604,634,drekamor,2024-10-13T20:20:30Z,SoundTech asked to add `type` because he wants to add others (e.g radius limit) in the future
1798558431,634,drekamor,2024-10-13T20:37:18Z,Making it an enum would mean adding yet another useless for anything else class. Can't make it a subclass because it needs to be accessed from different packages.
1798560699,634,Protonull,2024-10-13T20:41:04Z,Is a type really necessary? Just have a sealed interface and then [switch-instanceof](https://openjdk.org/jeps/441) it.
1798724440,634,awoo-civ,2024-10-14T04:03:36Z,"I do not understand the concern with adding another class, even if it was necessary which I don't think it is? Would defining a public enum in an already existing class not work just fine?

In any case, using a String is quite bad form as:
1. It can be anything - easy for bugs to sneak in
2. Finding out what it can be is near impossible

Enums fix these issues. 

BTW, I recently did this exact refactoring: https://github.com/Gjum/SnitchMod/commit/4babc246830f8667d2feb590ea298d02d3c8f7c2#diff-74f85b746999fee67db379e6128c815f7e0a3d0f1f5cb0d4e1a4471e2a20c8b6R12"

1800034949,634,okx-code,2024-10-14T20:22:57Z,"This shouldEnable() call is still unnecessary and will cause unexpected behaviour if something happens like the hack is disabled in the config, but then is enabled by a command."

1800046273,634,okx-code,2024-10-14T20:26:42Z,"Throwing is fine here as the exception will be handled and actually printed rather than discarded, so it's clearer what the problem actually is. See `org.bukkit.configuration.serialization.ConfigurationSerialization#deserializeViaMethod`"

1649377585,550,Protonull,2024-06-21T19:58:26Z,"Might be worth looking into serialised item stacks using `==:`, though we'd need to find/create an item creator that produces a YAML output."

1649398532,550,Protonull,2024-06-21T20:24:00Z,"Not sure these work, iirc `.getItemMeta()` creates a duplicate meta, so any changes to it would then need to be saved back onto the item."
1650280497,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-24T03:02:03Z,"Yeah, I think that'd be a much better solution just because of the volume of stuff that items can have now that needs to be checked for and assigned. I put something together using Bukkit's inbuilt ItemStack serialization that works pretty well, as well as a command in SAH to quickly see what a serialized item should look like in a config."
1651933180,550,Protonull,2024-06-25T03:17:55Z,"Small thing: it's better to do `Component.text("" has left the game"", NamedTextColor.YELLOW)` instead as then you aren't re-creating the component with the colour, but instead are colouring the original component.

1510193949,353,Diet-Cola,2024-03-03T06:26:42Z,No? We do multiple checks on the block first i.e if its air etc before creating the reinforcement

This also makes the above command unnecessary.

logger.debug(() -> ""[Chunkmeta] Unloading chunk "" + coord + "" - unloaded: "" + coord.getLastUnloadedTime())

1691607914,570,Huskydog9988,2024-07-25T14:56:24Z,Yes? But that seems to be the behavior already? It's probably worth adding a check and saying it failed anyway.
1699144074,570,Huskydog9988,2024-07-31T21:50:22Z,"ok so i just confirmed it, because of the conditional statement on line 13, it will never run on a failed build"
