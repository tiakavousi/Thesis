""_but i don't like those old function names_"" - fine, move those interfaces to a file you never touch, import it, and then you can forget about it - perfect for stability. this applies to every external facing endpoint url and parameter, whether that be rss, rest, rpc, whatever technique is used, stability comes first for the users and for the developers supporting the tool ;) that's my 2 cents, thanks for reading.",0,-1,-1,0.5174601078033447,0.982718825340271,0.9646754264831544,-1.0,accept,majority_agreement

624326811,12746,"the docs for the `mark_as_advanced()` command say: i don't use cmake guis, so this is not really relevant to my points. it could be useful to prune some low-level details for gui users by default though. if there turns out to be demand for this, i'll experiment with it and try to improve the gui experience. as for `cmake -lh`, it does show the option descriptions for application features (although it does not show the default for the setting, unless you embed it as part of the description like i did anyway). but it also shows many lines with stuff like this: qt5linguisttools_dir:path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/qt5linguisttools who cares about this? some people under some circumstances do, but most under most circumstances don't. those that do want to see this will know that they have to run `cmake -lh` (or possibly even `cmake -lah`) to see this anyway. i think listing the defaults for the important application features in the main output fills the gap of showing details about important stuff, but not _too much detail by default_. my point here was that you want your build system to some housekeeping on its own, but not to make very important decisions about the application itself automatically. for example, i don't think it is desirable for your build system to do decide defaults for application features based on installed packages. however, there are other things that it is most welcome to decide the defaults for. for instance, it is obviously desirable that cmake do certain things related to toolchain setup based on whether it's running on windows or linux without bothering you too much. imo it is not desirable to build gui by default on systems that have certain packages, and not do the same on others that don't. this hurts reproducibility (although i must state that having fully reproducible builds is not a goal at this point anyway) and most importantly, it makes it confusing to use imo. ""one man's noise is another man's freedom fighter"". or something like that. for most people it is very convenient that the script tells them the defaults. if you were compiling qbittorrent for the first time (or after some time where new options may have been added), wouldn't you like to see the defaults listed so that you know what you may want to override? there's information in this signal for the user of the build script. of course if you already know all options and their defaults by heart, you might not care about this information. yes, the options and their defaults can (and should, regardless) be listed in the documentation. but it's much more convenient this way, and even has the advantage that makes updating documentation easier. if we require that contributors keep the ""default: ..."" text updated in the build script itself, it serves as an authoritative source for the documentation. consider the current wiki article about cmake compilation in the wiki. a lot of the documentation about options and their defaults are very outdated. if this patch goes through, they will be even more so. someone will have to update the page eventually (i don't mind doing it myself). if the configure output lists the defaults, this will be trivial. otherwise, you'd have to go mucking through the script to figure it out (this is especially unpleasant if the defaults change based on packages found). i know what i'd much rather have to do. care to elaborate on the changes you find to be counter-productive to achieving the stated goals? yes, stuff related to `libtorrent` configuration and discovery is lacking right now, i want to address this but have had a few setbacks with my usual environment, apologies for the delay.",0,0,0,0.9412344694137572,0.9824876189231871,0.9587645530700684,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

624771335,12746,"let me repeat once again: the defaults are obvious from the cmake command that was used to run the configuration. those who have several qt versions installed? that is a significant part of what the configure systems are needed for and what they do, actually. for example, if i have systemd installed, obviously most of the time i want systemd service units from all packages that support systemd. when i have icu installed, obviously it is for software to use it. when i build qbittorrent in a linux environment i want it to detect that and show desktop notifications in the way my de can understand them. maybe the gui/headless switch is not the one that suits this paradigm in the best way, but nevertheless, the find package -> enable feature paradigm it is widely used. let's take a look at the main gentoo package tree. packages supporting cmake usually do that inheriting `cmake-utils` eclass. that gibberish means one can find those packages grep-ing for ""cmake-utils"" in the ebuild (gentoo package format) files. let's do that: [code block] among those 710, 57 contains no user choices (`grep -l 'cmake-utils' | .. | grep -l 'iuse'`, the ""iuse"" variable contains user choices). now, there are 62 packages that use `cmake_disable_find_package` directly (`grep -lr 'cmake_disable_find_package' | cut -d/ -f 1-2 | uniq | wc -l`) and 177 that use it via a wrapper in `cmake-utils` eclass (`grep -lr 'use_find_package' | cut -d/ -f 1-2 | uniq | wc -l`) thus, 239 packages (did not check that no packages use `use_find_package` + `cmake_disable_find_package` but i doubt there are any) out of 653 configurable cmake-based packages use `cmake_disable_find_package`, and this switch is relatively new. and (surprise!) cmake itself relies on `find_package(qt5widgets)` to decide whether to build its gui part. that is what i am talkig about: when i run cmake (e.g. without options), the enabled features are obviously enabled by default, because i did not enable them. the biggest change in cmake 3.0 is the encapsulation. targets became kind of objects which you can set up at one place, and they invoke ""spooky action at a distance"" when used. but you declared a move in the opposite direction as the goal, yet you also declared desire to use the modern cmake.",0,0,0,0.966203510761261,0.952580749988556,0.9513822793960572,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement
624936324,12746,"well, i guess that's true, but only as long as _all_ features are listed, both the enabled _and_ the disabled ones. otherwise how can one easily learn about all the available flags? ironically, however, seeing as it is such a widespread practice to surprise the user with feature activation based on installed packages, i think there's still value in informing the user that in qbittorrent's script, these are the defaults and that's it. no surprises. besides defaults, would you expect the user to ""guess"" relationships such as `systemd, (...) depends on condition: not gui`? i think this should also be printed out to the user. in that case you'd have to pass a few flags to select the correct one already, no (i really don't know, i never had more than one qt version at a time in my linux system)? if you're doing that anyway, it's not much more work to pass `-dverbose_configure` also. i doubt the majority of people building qbittorrent have multiple qt versions installed (although i'm aware i'm 100% speculating here). that flag is there precisely to support advanced use-cases. you're not always building for your own system, and even if you are, this way just provides sane defaults. it still tells you all about them so that you may further tailor the build to your needs no offense, but not an argument. what if most of those packages are not following best practices? what if their cmake scripts were written long ago? or what if someone started doing like that _just because_ and everyone else followed suit because it was the done thing? i've stated my logical reasons: don't do surprising things depending on the user's environment, and make it obvious what you need to do to disable each feature. in your way of doing things, suppose you see ""found packages x11, zlib, qtdbus and qtwidgets"" and ""enabled gui, power_management, and notifications"" in the output. even if you know ""oh, i must disable a corresponding package"", can you immediately guess which of those will be disabled by passing `-dcmake_disable_find_package_qtdbus=off` (it could disable more than one!)? i don't think it's very user-friendly. if you want to convince me that your way is better, you'll have to argue with something stronger than ""everybody does it"". if you can link to a book, blog post, video, etc arguing convincingly in favor, i'll be thankful and gladly educate myself on the subject. what move, specifically? i already stated that it won't be in _this_ pr that qbittorrent's cmake build script will fully migrate to just using `target_*` commands. this is just an attempt at simplifying the script, so that the move to a more target-based approach becomes easier, in a follow-up pr. i think so far, the changes will help the migration. for example, previously, the feature options macro called `add_definitions`. now it doesn't, and it will be simpler to convert the resulting `add_compile_definitions` into `target_compile_definitions`. also, the script that added compile options directly manipulated the `cxx_flags` and had a lot of unneeded stuff. now it doesn't, and this will make future changes easier.",0,0,0,0.8165969252586365,0.8188581466674805,0.9606704711914062,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

626092396,12746,"thanks for the feedback. i will attempt to address the macos concerns you mentioned later. currently this only happens if libtorrent was also built with cmake because the needed cmake scripts will get picked up by the `cmake_prefix_path` (or alternatively but slightly different, `libtorrentrasterbar_root`) passed to qbittorrent. i think it is reasonable to expect libtorrent to be built with cmake, but if i have time and if it is not too messy, i'll add a fallback to cover the case where libtorrent was not built with cmake on windows. for linux i expect to be able to use the `pkg-config` method mentioned above, which i have yet to test. so far it looks like the current changes work well on windows with or without vcpkg, but i still have some things to test out. about the compilation speed and binary sizes difference: - not sure why you're getting such a huge discrepancy on compile times. could it be probably some macos oddity? either way, not a problem since this version is the fastest - the differences in binary sizes could be due to a multitude of things. if someone has a suggestion of how to remove the extra weight, that would be great, but if not i don't think an extra 4 mib is a big concern. right now i also have to fix an issue that i can currently reproduce on windows and linux: in the about dialog, the ""special thanks"", ""translators"" and ""license"" tabs are blank.",1,1,1,0.8838058710098267,0.9321357011795044,0.9654229283332824,1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

629564830,12746,"alright, at this point i have tested everything on windows that needed to be tested imo. in particular, i tried the following, successfully: - followed the steps at [a link] (which is basically the same as the official msvc2017 method but with some version bumps for convenience when using the latest toolchain) to compile every dependency **except** `libtorrent`. - instead of compiling `libtorrent` like in the tutorial, i did the equivalent cmake build: [code block] this is so that the `libtorrent` build produces the needed cmake config files to use in the actual qbittorrent compilation. - compiled qbittorrent itself using the manually-built dependencies: [code block] and... it worked! note that other configure flag combinations would have achieved the same result; for instance, you could use the necessary openssl, libtorrent and possibly zlib hints instead of `cmake_prefix_path`. this is just to prove that the new scripts are not dependent on the usage of `vcpkg` or anything like that. the user can manually specify the paths to the dependency artifacts in the command-line and it will build just fine. the only requirement is that libtorrent is built with the cmake method, so that it produces the necessary cmake configuration files. the best thing is that one can even ""fly blind"", because cmake holds your hand and gives useful suggestions. for example, suppose that after building the required dependencies, you were trying to build qbittorrent (but did not know how to) and started with this: [code block] cmake would then complain ""could not find package xyz, please specify `xyz_dir` blah blah"". you add what it asks for and run it again (let's say it was `qt5`): [code block] then the process repeats for each required package, until the configure is successful. then the build can actually be executed: [code block] note that in all of these examples i did not specify a generator. since this was tested on an x64 windows installation with msvc2019, this is equivalent to `-g ""visual studio 16 2019"" -a x64`. i also tested with `-g ""ninja multi-config""`, `-g ""ninja""` and `-g ""nmake makefiles jom""`. note that in the latter 2 cases, the `--config` flag at build/install time is ignored due to them being single config generators, so one must specify the build config with `-dcmake_build_type` at configure time. one cool thing that the cmake scripts now easily enable, it the possibility of using dependencies from different sources very in summary, these are the advantages that cmake scripts at this point over qmake: - feedback-rich configure step - no need to manually edit files - all useful configuration options can be specified via the command line. - integrates well with modern ""dependency package managers"" like `vcpkg` - at least as fast and vs. the current cmake setup: - simpler and cleaned up (and thus more readable and easily understandable for further development) - usability improvements - less surprising behavior - easier to further evolve to a more target-based architecture right now there are still two outstanding todos: - the libtorrent c++ standard abi compatibility question (could allow dropping another file) - the version bumps. though, to be fair, at this point i'll probably just leave them in, and wait out for things like `rc_1_1` support removal, qt 5.15 (because it makes openssl 1.1.1 mandatory), and for people to realize that boost <1.60 is irrelevant because it hasn't been used for official windows/macos builds in a very long time, and we don't even support debian/ubuntu releases that support such old boost versions. after that, this pr will exit draft and will be ready to be properly reviewed and merged. i'll probably need to split this up into multiple commits as well.",0,0,0,0.8339344263076782,0.9718106389045716,0.9376820921897888,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

657476593,12746,"i assume this complaint refers to the increased use of generator expressions. i agree that generator expressions can be rather... unsightly, but there are some nice benefits of doing it this way. now, each target has at most one `target_link_libraries()` call, one `target_compile_definitions()` call, etc (basically, only one call of each of the `target_*` commands per target). no need to hunt down multiple calls of `target_xyz()` inside multiple conditional branches, possibly across multiple cmake files, to figure out the final set of compile defintions, options, etc for a given target in a given configuration/feature selection. thus, the scripts become more readable and maintainable (despite the fact that generator expressions themselves are not very readable). for example, to know _all_ the compile definitions of `base`, you just read the _single_ `target_compile_definitions()` call for it and the `interface`/`public` compile definitions of the targets it links to (the latter is easy if the targets `base` links to also have a _single_ `target_compile_definitions()` call, and so forth, recursively). then, depending on the features selected, compiler used, and os, you add or subtract the corresponding definitions by looking at the generator expressions inside the call (e.g. if you're on linux, you can ignore anything resembling `$ , ...`). very little imperative logic to reason about. additionally, imo it provides a sort of nice heuristic to reason about complexity, akin to the classic ""if you've got greater than 3 levels of nested loops, it's probably doing to much"": ""if your generator expressions are becoming too long, you probably need to rethink some aspect of your build script"". (this is also an attempt at a preemptive counter-argument against ""this approach does not scale because generator expressions become exponentially unreadable with their length""). if you look at the build scripts now, the vast majority of the complexity comes from the translation handling and macos bundle stuff in `src/app`, which has to be done in a complex, imperative way that's hard to follow, but that's mostly qt's fault. as qt's cmake support improves with qt6, i would expect that particular situation to improve, so that that bit can be re-written in a clearer way in the future. everything else is easier to follow and reason about, imo.",0,0,0,0.7884241938591003,0.6823905110359192,0.793734610080719,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

670009173,12746,"by ""one place"" i did not mean necessarily ""in the same file"" - it's independent of that. i was referring to the fact that for any given important aspect of a target (definitions, link options, compile options, ...), you only have to refer to, ideally, 1 place. take the `qbt_gui` target and its compile definitions as an example. it is a better user, developer and maintainer experience if all the information you need about its compile definitions is in one place (or at least, as few as possible), that you then examine according the specific platform you want to know details about, vs hunting down multiple `target_compile_definitions()` calls across conditional branches. i think it's clear that genexps help in this matter of ""increasing locality"" both in the single file and multiple file case, though honestly i would also guess that the advantage is probably more pronounced in the single file case. thanks to ""better locality"", i would argue the code is more readable now. in that snippet above, in total there were: - 3 calls to `target_sources` - 3 calls to `add_compile_options` (this changed to `target_compile_options`, so we treat it as such for this example) - 2 calls to ` target_link_libraries`, which in the modern approach also conceal 2 more calls to `target_link_options` (but one of these was dropped, so we'll count only 1). all of them interspersed throughout a somewhat complex branching structure you had to carefully analyze to understand what was going on. if you cared about only one thing, such as `compile options` (imagine you wanted to change it or something), and did not care about linked libraries or options, you'd still have to look at it all. plus, depending on other features, you might also have to repeat the process for more `if ()` chains somewhere else in the file. in total, there are now, in that file: - 2 calls to `target_sources` (this could, and should have easily been reduced to 1 by putting a single `target_sources` call after the whole `# translations, resources and bundle stuff` section, but it's not that much of a problem and i'm not going to change it now) - 1 call to `target_compile_options` - 1 call to `target_link_libraries` - 1 call to `target_link_options` all of them nicely separated from one another. want to know about the linked libraries? just look at the single `target_link_libraries()` command, you are not forced to look at anything else by a branching structure. now, if you only care about compile options, you just look at the single `target_compile_options(qbittorrent ...)` call; no other conditions/link options/etc distracting you. then, you look at the genexps, which are not even that hard to parse, and figure out the ones that apply to your case. in this particular case, suppose you are on linux; you don't even need to read them all; just notice they all start with `$<$ ,...` and come to the conclusion that no additional compile options are added to the target. i believe so; this has been my experience. with `if()`s, depending on the scope of the refactoring, you might have to carefully rearrange the branching structure. with genexps you will most often add new ones or remove existing ones, or occasionally tweak existing ones, but their order inside the `target_*()` call does not matter, for example, which is a big plus. you basically don't need to think about control flow. what exactly do you mean by ""real logical structure of dependencies""? if you mean ""modeling of target requirements"", i think a genexp-based approach does a better job at this, because first and foremost, every target in any project is made up of compile options, definitions, link options, etc. then, adjustments to each of these may be made based on the platform or chosen feature set (this is what genexps do). the `if ()` approach leads to ""thinking backwards"", i.e., you first think in terms of platform and feature set, and then add compile options/definitions/etc piece-meal. based on my previous explanations, i hope i have convinced you that this is more brittle, because requirements become more entangled by the imperative logic. plus, in terms of structure, what has ""precedence""? the feature, the platform, something else, or does it depend on whichever approach yields the simplest structure? in the snippet above, `if(stacktrace)` is on the outside and `if(msvc)` is on the inside (so, the feature has precedence), but would have this remained consistent? with genexps there is no decision to be made. imagine you wanted to remove the `webui` and/or the `stacktrace` feature; i think it's easy to see this would be easier and faster to do correctly with the genexp approach vs the `if()` approach in general. edit: i realize now that this last sentence, excluding the ""in general"" part, is a poor example, since i believe before it also happened to be possible to remove these features easily.",0,0,0,0.848540723323822,0.9497225880622864,0.9717395901679992,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

406881663,8584,"personally, i would prefer to allow only one search per session. this would greatly simplify the server-side implementation and eliminate many security problems. even in gui we do not allow to have several active searches! we only allow you to have a lot of completed searches (or interrupted), but in the case of a webui it can be implemented on the client side. let's summarize! **implementation 1** (one search is allowed): 1. user can start search and get its results. 2. when user starts new search the current one is destroyed. 3. if user want to store results of any previous search it make it on the client-side. 4. (possible optimization) search controller tracks last access time and destroys the inactive search (in case user still use the current session but it doesn't use search controller anymore). **implementation 2** (one active search is allowed, like in gui): 1. user can start search and get results of any previous search by its id. 2. when user starts new search the current one is interrupted. 3. user can manually delete any existing search. 4. search controller tracks last access time and destroys the inactive searches (in case user still use the search controller but it doesn't use some particular searches and didn't delete them itself). 5. max searches count is limited. when user starts new search and it exceeds the limit, the least active search is deleted. 6. (possible optimization) search controller destroys the inactive searches (in case user still use the current session but it doesn't use search controller anymore). **implementation 3** (several active searches are allowed): *same as above except par. 2* but why should we allow such implementation? each search job can starts several threads/processes. even if we allow 10 concurrent searches this can create unnecessary load on the server side. but the main question, why this need? why do you need to run multiple concurrent searches? i don't want to delay this pr, it's already taking too long. but we cannot move forward without addressing these fundamental issues. , please comment the overall feature implementation without code details.",0,0,0,0.7758136987686157,0.5426283478736877,0.8311921954154968,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

599991903,12144,"here s my general review. first of all i strongly object the development way when you adjust base classes to fit upper level needs. ideally any base class should implement some subject domain model and it should has corresponding interface (that has a meaning in terms of implement subject domain). as of logger class the complete interface could be the following, imo: 1. add message of some type 2. get messages (either all or the rest since some timepoint, assuming we have precision of ""timepoint"" type that is enough to keep timepoints unique) 3. notify when new message is added there is no point to obtain some specific message of from log since user wants to see either all log or its part starting from some timepoint it didn't see before. of course it requires the messages to be cached in ""presentation"" model. but as far as i can tell, it shouldn't cause any significant problems. on the contrary, i see some additional improvements: 1. don't touch logger several times per ""presentation"" model item access (currently you call it for each data role) 2. store view-friendly data to avoid multiple conversions. 3. have differed item count than the log itself (imo, it's a really good idea to show less messages than logger itself can contain). current model/view classes have the following disadvantages: 1. many of duplicated code due to the fact we have log and peerlog that provide the similar functionality except the item type. 2. unjustifiably creating specific to ""logging"" view types that don't actually have any specific logic, so we can use generic types instead.",0,0,-1,0.932579219341278,0.9478447437286376,0.5681318640708923,0.0,accept,majority_agreement

196337357,4936,"i found the ""progress line"" to be useful in 2 cases: **1**. a little trick that i found myself: when i'm taking a break, like going o eat or something, i just leave the pointer of my mouse at the end of it. when i get back, i look how much the end of line has moved from where my mouse pointer is. if it didn't move, it's clear to me that it didn't download anything more. i don't think i'll remember the percentange, especially if it's a floating point number and this method seems faster than writing the number in a text file for later comparison. **2**. good to detect slowdowns on hard drives. if i remember right, i think that once i detected that the antivirus was running an automated scan because i was looking at the progress line after doing a force rechek on a torrent and it seemed to me that the line was moving too slow compared to other times. i think that i wouldn't have noticed anything looking at the percentage number. maybe it's my brain that likes graphs more than numbers... and it's easier for it to see a grahical overview than the exact number. i thought that qbittorrent tried to offer a simmilar ui to μtorrent keeping as much as possible of the good features in μtorrent. this seems to me like a good feature which takes little vertical space. if you can't add it, don't wory, it's ok. thanks for asking why do i need it for. btw, about this pr, showing the files in the tooltip looks like a nice feature.",0,0,1,0.4869320392608642,0.6883025765419006,0.7067102193832397,0.0,accept,majority_agreement

277904000,5287,"this update to the feature looks good. i'm going to test it out again and report back! just from looking at the code, there's two very minor things i think would be good chances to make: 1. change the `qregexp` instance that's used to find the episode number to be case insensitive. i.e. change line 157 of `rssdownloadrule.cpp` to: `qregexp f(episoderegex, qt::caseinsensitive);` edit: making it case insensitive would also require changing `computeepisodename()` to be case insensitive as well. i recommend adding something like `matchedepisode = matchedepisode.tolower();` to the top of the function and then changing all of the conditionals to use lowercase letters, so the first if statement becomes `if (matchedepisode.startswith('s'))` and `qregexp r(""s(\\d+)e(\\d+)"");` becomes `qregexp r(""s(\\d+)e(\\d+)"");`. 2. consider changing the regex itself to allow the episode number group to be at either the beginning or end of the string. right now it has to be bordered by a non-alphanumeric character and there's always that small chance that someone will have an rss feed that begins or ends with the episode number. so specifically i'm recommending replacing line 43 of `rssdownloadrule.cpp` to: const qstring episoderegex = ""(?:^|[^a-za-z0-9])((?:s\\d{1,}(?:e\\d{1,})+)|(?:\\d{1,}x\\d{1,})|(?:\\d{4}\\.\\d{2}\\.\\d{2}))(?:[^a-za-z0-9]|$)""; ...which i think accomplishes what i'm suggesting. like i said, these are quite minor, and i think the feature will work fine without them. i just always am trying to look out for those few edge cases that'll snag a small minority of users. :winking_face:",1,1,1,0.8472232222557068,0.960654616355896,0.995534896850586,1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

[a link] building `qfileinfo` from the item does nothing but appends the current working directory to a relative name. to elaborate, imagine `name()` return `debian-9.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso`, in this case given working dir set to `/users/myuser/` the newly created `qfileinfo` will be built with `/users/myuser/debian-9.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso` path. and the actual file location could be `/users/myuser/downloads/debian-9.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso`. obviously icon lookup will always fail when the downloaded file resides in a folder different from the working directory. that's because `iconforfile:` needs an actual file, and you give it a completely invalid path. how does it even work on the other platforms? i do not understand why qfileinfo is even used here, especially since the detection could only happen by an extension, and since qfileinfo is believed to be slow. what needs to be done here (especially given that one should be able to see the icons before downloading anything) is just a plain extension-based lookup. so i enforced `mimefileiconprovider`, simplified it a little to avoid qfileinfo, and added some prints of the icon names and mimes: [code block] so far so good, but `qicon::fromtheme` from both of those returns a null icon. the docs say that this function appears to be a linux hack compatible with some kind of linux-only spec with an ability of gluing to a local icon database @. sounds mad and of course does not work, on macos you have [a link], which should be used in a similar way to [a link] :/. given the overall code craziness, could you please rework this? if you want to use file-based icon matching, please provide a valid file path. otherwise this should be eliminated for good, along with the ugly test attempting to achieve nothing. here is a [a link] required to get things work on macos. i could submit a pull-request with just this to make it in time for 3.4.0. or it could be used as a reference for the refactoring of this code by somebody else. cc , , , , .",0,0,0,0.9663124680519104,0.983340322971344,0.9191641211509703,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

[a link] [a link] overall, i think the patch is still a regression, but perhaps it can become the way forward with more polish. ideally, torrents would be added faster, and announces would occur asynchronously with torrents being added. edit: also, i'm pleased to report that both with and without the patch, closing the client mid startup doesn't corrupt/delete the .fastresumes.",1,1,0,0.4831689894199371,0.8345409631729126,0.5181244611740112,1.0,accept,majority_agreement
697134517,13348,"well, i recently pushed through new changes to test other ways to speed up qbittorrent launch. they include asynchronous reading of resume data files in a separate thread, as well as processing alerts one at a time. you can test it in two ways: including and not including the last commit (, can you provide 2 corresponding builds?) in the latter case, you can evaluate what asynchronous data reading does by itself. although the last commit makes the ui more responsive during the session loading process (it does in my tests, but in yours?), this process itself stretches over time. this demonstrates that having a large number of alerts when restoring a session is the root of the problem. but it seems that this is not due to the fact (not only) that we have to process a lot of alerts at a time, which leads to interrupting the main thread, but because it causes a lot of work in the gui layer, which also leads to poor responsiveness. my other experiments show that populating the gui after the session is fully restored is significantly faster. i still have limited testing capabilities, so i'm waiting for your results. i am particularly interested in your opinion on asynchronous reading of resume data files. does it deserve to be merged on its own?",0,0,0,0.9645949006080629,0.976545512676239,0.973607063293457,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

697297865,13348,"as noted in [a link] my observations in the latest comments are in reference to the very latest commit (so, including all changes from it and the previous ones). my observation was that the main improvement was gui startup time. as stated previously, before the patch, the gui takes more time to load on startup, but _after_ it actually loads, the responsiveness is comparable/the same as with the patch (at least i don't have the means of measuring a scientifically significant difference). the biggest downside of the patch is that it takes much longer to add all torrents (like you say, ""the process itself stretches over time""). thus, all things considered, the startup time has regressed with the patch. perhaps the alerts relating to torrent loading need to be batched instead of handled one at a time? yes, if you watch the video in [a link] it clearly shows the impact that more gui activity has on performance, when i switch between filters with no/all torrents. yes, this is what i observe without the patch as well (in current master). i explain my opinion about the behavior in current master and the latest version of this pr in my latest comments ([a link] and [a link] respectively), which include videos/callgrind captures that will probably be useful to you. i can specifically test just the part about asynchronous load of fastresumes with nothing else (i.e., excluding the latest commit about handling alerts one at a time), but regardless of the effects on gui startup time, if it amounts to (too much of) a regression in overall startup time, i won't be in favor or merging it. if certain parts of the gui are not updating when they should, while other parts are clearly able to do so, that can be a problem. but my original hypothesis was that the tracker-related alerts simply happened to be placed at the end of the queue, after all alerts related to adding/loading torrents, hence the delay. again, i encourage you to watch the videos i posted, to get a visual feel for what's happening.",0,0,0,0.548602283000946,0.9752359390258788,0.9562638998031616,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

699535399,13348,"if you're picking a number of milliseconds to delay before updating the gui, or a number of alerts to process before updating the gui; whichever number you pick, it will be too few for some and too high for others. i really think it would be much better to approach this in a way that *adapts* to the load, to get the best of both worlds. nagle's algorithm is an example of this. if there's just one alert, don't delay at all. while that first alert is ""outstanding"" (i.e. updating the gui) new alerts should not trigger a gui update until the first one is done. that way, if you get single alerts, there's no delay. if you get a large number of them, the batching is based on the time it takes to complete one gui update. now, i'm not very familiar with the details of qt, but perhaps this is tricky. perhaps updating the gui is synchronous and there's no way to receive more alerts while it's happening. there's one simple solution to this: instead of triggering the gui update in the message handler, post a message to the queue (at the end of the queue, *after* all the alerts that you have to handle that are currently queued up). in that message handler you posted, that's where you trigger the gui update. alternatively, if you call `pop_alerts()`, don't update the gui until you've run the handlers for *all* alerts you got back from that call. that would also give you an adaptable batching of gui updates. this is basically the same thing i suggested earlier, which was explained to not be as simple as i made it out to be. clearly i'm not familiar with the details of the internals, but i would encourage trying to come up with ways to have ""natural"" batching of updates.",0,0,0,0.8174813985824585,0.9446643590927124,0.8642449975013733,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

'normal' mode also helps quite a bit, while not introducing concerns about database corruption. i.e. your database will always be corruption-free, and will always only contain the results of some previously completed transaction. however, you risk an exceptionally tiny change that *some committed transaction* **might** be lost if you lose power at some precise moment. again, your data will not be corrupt. simply, you might lose a transaction that in 'full' mode would reapply if power is lost at a specific moment. for the roslyn use case, this was perfect. a lost transaction simply meant we'd recompute the data later on. for qb, it's unclear what it would mean. i get the sense that you ahve to validate data anyways on a non-clean shutdown. so i imagine things will be fine for you. just something to consider in order to ensure that your db is not a bottleneck if you are writing data to it non-stop. -- note: as someone who has a huge amount of torrents, i have a personal vested interest here. i dont' know what the write patterns are for qb. but, for example, if it routinely making thousands of transactions because there are all these torrents, then wal will go a long way to making that crawl, to making it something you'd never notice. thanks!",0,0,0,0.5296953320503235,0.9641189575195312,0.7082254886627197,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement
455798513,10099,"another important consideration was that we pooled db connections. each connection is safe to use across different threads *as long as* you are not using it across threads simultaneously. so, we would only make a new connection if we had no existing ones available. then, once done, it would go back in the pool ready to be used by any other thread. you can see that code here: [a link] this is helpful for performance as each connection incurs a fixed creation cost, especially where it needs to grovel the db to hydrate the metadata for it and whanot. similarly, parameterized query statements were cached. this is useful so you can keep issuing the same statements (with different parameter values) without incurring the fixed overhead of parsing/analyzing the statement. sqlite can do that computation once and then benefit from it every other time. -- note: i have not used qt's api for sqlite. it's possible they take care of this for you. def something to look into if they do not. -- now, if you're only rarely reading/writing from your db. or you don't need to scale reads/writes with number-of-torrents, then this likely isn't going to be an issue. however, if you're reading/writing many times a second, and you need to *increase* reads/writes based on something related to user-data (i.e. how many torrents they have) then these sorts of approaches really streamline things and make sqlite operate in much of a bare-metal fashion. cheers!",0,0,0,0.917136251926422,0.900844395160675,0.9683029651641846,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

466468902,10099,"note: all my current and further comments about this pr assume that we use libtorrent-1.2 as the main (and libtorrent-1.1 as compatible). my suggestions are based on the fact that we keep track of most of the torrent data all the time the qbittorrent is running (except for a few not so important ""fastresume"" fields) so it is redundant to generate the same data again. if we save/load the fastresume itself verbatim, we don't need to worry since libtorrent will handle everything correctly. am i worried too much about this? i don't think that should make us uncomfortable. unlike previous versions libtorrent-1.2 handle fastresume data not as raw data but as add_torrent_params struct that is a part of libtorrent abi. knowing 's tendency to maintain a compatible abi throughout the libtorrent branch, we can be sure that it will not change during libtorrent-1.2 life cycle (at least, it will not change often/much). in that case, i would suggest another way. take a closer look. in fact, we have diverse data. some of them represent ""important"" properties of the torrent, such as its settings and the current download/upload status (eg., save_path, ""file mapping"", different kind of priorities, paused, auto_managed etc.; usually this is all that is affected by the user). they are likely to be ""stable"" for a long time (will not be deleted/changed) so these fields should be stored in separate columns. all remaining data (not so ""important""; usually this is all that is generated/obtained by libtorrent itself) can be serialized and stored in a single column (but in this case i would highly recommend using a more readable format than ""bencode"", e.g. json).",0,0,0,0.7594976425170898,0.611873209476471,0.937437117099762,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

278238657,6186,"rebased on top of master and hopefully addressed all comments (either in discussion or code). i've included commit 417ec61 which moves the status icons out to their own directory - let me know if you don't want it and i'll remove it from the pr. i've simplified the api somewhat, and in particular `iconprovider::geticonpath()` no longer takes an optional parameter. instead, the icon path is hard-coded to `:icons/skin/` (or `:/icons/status/` with 417ec61). theme detection now takes place in `guiiconprovider::configure()`, which emits `guiiconprovider::themechanged()` if there actually was a change. this will either be called from `mainwindow::event()` (via `guiiconprovider::updatetheme()`) in response to a palette change, or due to a `preferences::changed()` signal (for small/large status icons). anything which needs to be notified of a theme change simply connects to `guiiconprovider::themechanged()`. btw i've kept the ""large"" status icon terminology as the current votes are currently 2 in favour (, ) to 1 against (). i've also used `static const` `qlatin1string` and `qcolor` inside `torrentmodel::geticonid()` and `torrentmodel::getcolorbystate()`. i think it makes the code more self-documenting (and potentially slightly more efficient, though unlikely to be significant). at one point this was a simple 6-line pr ...",0,0,0,0.5785180926322937,0.9719817638397216,0.9078336358070374,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

200560764,4984,"let me elaborate on the changes introduced to clear a few things up. `session.cpp` is modified to set external ip address to `announce_ip`. that is how a client tells its public ip even operating in a private network. announcement url parameters `info_hash` and `peer_id` are just random 20-byte binary strings. qt5's `qurlquery` wouldn't decode the parameters fully as it normally expects utf-8 strings. sometimes it could lead to different ""half-decoded"" strings corresponding to one binary string, making the decoding function non-bijective (not one-to-one). therefore files `webapplication.cpp`, `webapplication.h`, `requestparser.h`, `requestparser.cpp`, `irequesthandler.h` and `connection.cpp` are changed to make url parameters decoding optional and turn it off for embedded tracker (via `configurerequestparser()` request and then invoking `disableurlparameterdecoding()` on `parser`), and let the tracker percent-decode the parameters. still, when string decoding fails for some reason, the string is stored in a hashtable as a key thereby preserving the way tracker used to operate before for erroneous strings. that’s why several `if` clauses are introduced in `tracker.cpp` static functions in `iputil` and `isnonroutable()` in particular are introduced in `tracker.cpp` to determine whether given ip address is public (external). these functions are used in `peer::getipforclient(clientip)` to retrieve public ip for a given peer if the `clientip` is public. otherwise it falls back to connection ip. if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to tell.",0,0,0,0.9839255809783936,0.9664154648780824,0.9878201484680176,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

[a link] you violated the separation, that is, gathering/copying dependencies at the building step. it seems to me like these statements contradict each other. if there is supposed to be a clear distinction between ""install"" and ""build"", why is it suggested that i run the ""install"" step if i just want to build for debugging? the install step is not meant to be executed as part of the normal development cycle. no. building step should produce artifacts _and do whatever else is necessary in order for the executable to be usable for the build folder_. in general, on linux nothing else needs to be done. on windows, it means potentially gathering and copying in artifacts to the build folder. the purpose of the install step is to gather all artifacts for deployment for deployment on an ""actual"" install location, to simulate what will end up on the users' machine. of course, these need not be the same, in qbittorrent's case it just so happens that the artifacts copied are all the same. but suppose we started including the `readme.md` and `license` files as part of the installation; in this case, these files _wouldn't_ be copied as part of the build, but _would_ be copied as part of the installation, because their presence doesn't affect debugging in any way, it is only important to check that they would actually be deployed in the the `install` step. similarly, i have noticed `windeployqt.exe` also copies `vc_redist.exe` as part of the gathering of runtime dependencies; i assume it does this for convenience, in case someone needs to update/install it, but clearly we're not going to copy it in the install step. so as you can see, i actually agree with you that there is a separation, i just think you're not right when claiming that `.dll`s and other stuff should not be copied as part of the build step on windows - because if you don't, you're just shifting the workload onto the developer to do additional setup to get debugging to work. as i've shown by the link to the google search above, this is a practice that is widely expected. but if you want to argue ""those are just noobs"", then i refer you to this comment by the maintainer of cmake himself: [a link] (and really, that whole thread and related threads), if you are more receptive to that argument of authority. you should consider that you may be a bit out of touch here. why do you oppose this ""feature"" to the process of building/installing dependencies? it's still required, isn't it? as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, running the ""install"" step as part of the normal edit/compile/debug step is in violation of the separation of concerns that you guys champion. it seems to me you're implying the ""windows way"" is at completely at odds with the general and widespread use of the cli and cli tools on windows. this is no longer the case, if you look at what microsoft has been doing for a while now. in the past years they have made a great effort to provide better command-line tooling. if there's a gui on top of that to expedite certain common workflows, great, but the cli is no longer a second-class citizen on windows. look at powershell core, `winget`, `vcpkg`, wsl, the new windows terminal (and the resulting opensourcing of much of their core terminal infrastructure), and many other things. these are all part of improving the developer experience. the newbies who use the gui (and experts with a lot of muscle memory for it) can still use it, now the experts and power users who prefer the cli are also much better served. yes, it is possible. you can open the dialogs in visual studio or whatever to define the correct settings. or, with this change, you don't need to do it. it is also possible to define those settings, paths, etc. via the command line - again, with this change, you don't need to do it. this is not about gui vs cli. it's about having to do less work with _both_ by default. i said i _personally preferred it_, and others may as well _if_ they have certain special requirements. i did not say others _should_ do the same. you can also use the installer (the more ""windows"" way), and won't be worse off for it. if one can do math with an abacus, why do we need calculators? yes, this is an exaggeration, but the point is that in that sentence you're implicitly recognizing that there _is_ an advantage in implementing this change, but you don't want it essentially _because in your opinion he current status quo is not that much harder_. if it can be improved with no downside, why not do it? --- anyway, speaking of ""no downside"", let's look at this in practical terms: in what way does this new way of doing things impact you negatively? if you can provide objective reasons for why this breaks/worsens _your_ workflow, i can start to work on solutions with you. after all, i don't want to implement something at your- or anyone else's expense whose workflow would be disrupted by this change. but, if it's all the same to you, why prevent implementing _and enabling by default_ a feature that is clearly useful for many other people, and improves their experience?

i'd really like to have at least something working asap. in fact, given the historical opposition to keeping up with recent cmake versions in this project (which can even be seen in this very pr once again already), i can't even think about what will happen when i propose _yet another_ bump in the span of only a few weeks, and for how long that will be stonewalled... in the meantime, i'd like to make this functionality available. in a way, you can think about the current implementation as ""insurance"". for your convenience, i post here a snippet from the newly added documentation about this future feature: the locations of all the ``shared`` and ``module`` targets in the target's transitive dependencies. using this generator expression on targets other than executables, ``shared`` libraries, and ``module`` libraries is an error. on non-dll platforms, it evaluates to an empty string. depends on into its output directory in a ``post_build`` custom command. for example: --- the current implementation finds the dlls based on the values stored in variables set by the `find.*` module of the libraries themselves (for example, `openssl_crypto_library` and `imported_location.*`). so this is as reliable as it gets, if you can't trust the values that the built-in `findopenssl` provides you with (or some other library that you're consuming, even if it doesn't have a built-in `find.*` module), you can't trust anything. what we're after here are the imported location properties, and then we just find the dll in `../bin` relative to that directory, because they use the classic unix-style installation layout. if the library you're consuming sets these incorrectly, that is a bug in either the cmake config file provided by the library itself or the `find.*` module you're using to find it. as for what is probably the ugliest wart, `zlib_names_list`: it was not made up by me. i simply copied all the possible names from the upstream `findzlib` module. i think this is sufficient - if it's good enough for the rest of the world, its good enough for us. i have tested this both with and without vcpkg, and it worked as expected in both cases, which is a good proof of reliability. i agree that especially the zlib part is ugly. but i had to work with what i had; i encourage you to go read the upstream `findopenssl` and `findzlib` modules to double-check what they make available to you. there are quite some differences between the two, but the end result is that it is much simpler to write robust code to find the dll with what `findopenssl` provides than `findzlib`. i'm convinced this is the simplest possible way to handle the information given by `findzlib` and find the `.dll` robustly, but if you have suggestions for improvement, i'd be glad to hear it. anyway, tucking this away in its own file as suggested above in a review will at least keep its ""monstrosity"" out of sight and more manageable. now, for more specific answers: best case: it is a ""good citizen"" like libtorrent, and we can just add `""$ ""` to the `add_custom_command(target qbt_app post_build command ""${cmake_command}"" -e copy_if_different ...)` call. medium case: we have to add code similar to the case for openssl (maybe even slightly simpler) worst case: code similar to the case for zlib. in practice, i don't expect we'll add any new dependency any time soon, and by the time we do, we'll have already transitioned to the simpler built-in way of cmake >= 3.21 that i plan to change to later. with the current implementation, we'd have to handle transitive dependencies ourselves. not ideal, but doable (i'd fully commit to doing that if were needed!). in practice, the only thing we currently use that has a bunch of transitive dependency dlls is qt, and that is entirely handled by `windeployqt.exe`. also, again, i don't expect we'll add any new dependency with transitive dependencies any time soon, and by the time we might do so, we'll have already transitioned to the cmake >= 3.21 method, which, as you can read in the documentation, handles transitive dependencies for you.",0,1,0,0.6161983609199524,0.761570155620575,0.8919167518615723,0.0,accept,majority_agreement

(because you don't care about mine, do you?) if the above is not valid, then let's try to continue._ **i'm really trying to find proof that this is a really useful thing** (although you may not believe me). that's how i understand it. to begin with, ""copying all dependencies to the build folder on each build"" instead of ""one-time setting of environment variables"" is inherently irrational. even the fact that the actual copying does not happen every time, but only after checking the files for changes, does not cancel its irrationality. after all, doing something (quite trivial for someone who decided to build an application) once looks much more rational than doing something with each build! of course, you will object that the user have to manually set the environment variables, _which is extremely difficult, etc._, and the copying is performed by the build system behind the scene and does not bother the user. but, as i mentioned in passing above, this should not be a problem for a user who decides to build an application on his own for the purpose of testing and debugging it, otherwise his mental abilities cause great doubt that he should do this at all. and besides, it does still bother the user, if we are talking specifically about the developer, as users of the build system, who can invoke the build quite often, so even a few extra seconds that it will spend each time checking/copying dependencies can greatly irritate him. (the above gives me enough reason to make this feature at least optional and disabled by default.) let's move on... well, maybe it has some other advantage that could offset its shortcomings? we'll see... could it be this? it does ""make installation trivial"" by simply moving the execution of all non-trivial actions from the installation step to the build step! this is obviously illogical, because the build step is performed much more often than the installation step, and most of the build cases do not imply further installation (if we are talking about developers workflow). in addition, it is not clear why it is impossible to still have this non-trivial logic where it is really required (in installation procedure)? sorry, i didn't find any proof why copying runtime dependencies to a single location **exactly at the build step** makes the installation process easier. this does not apply to this topic at all. no need to abuse it. i really like the idea of an automated build, so releasing the next version would just be adding a tag to the repository. what i don't like is the way that is suggested in this pr.",-1,0,1,0.8729629516601562,0.3842531442642212,0.7458661794662476,,review,no_majority_disagreement
864569453,14959,"wrong :) yes, i substantiate my arguments. that's a bad thing? you keep insisting on some vague notion of ""formal proofs"" in contexts where it does not make much sense. this is not a mathematical discussion. this is about conventions and making development experience easier. in some cases (such as this one) substantiating ones position by showing that many others do the same thing **is** the ultimate form proof that you need. unless you are doing some really weird/novel thing (which is not the case for qbittorrent, it is a relatively simple gui download manager), it is a good thing to do certain things the same tried and true way that others do it. see [a link] of course ""many people do it x way, so we should also do it"" is a very dangerous way to think _in general_, and i'm sure you agree with that. but, in this case and others, it is a good thing to do the ""standard"" thing and/or the thing that many people request to be done a certain way. i do care about your opinion, otherwise i wouldn't bother engaging with you. it is valuable to engage with people with different perspectives. i believe you. the thing is, you seem to think i'm trying to convince you that this is a ""really useful thing"" _for you_. that is not what i'm trying to do. this might in fact never be useful _for you_, and that's completely fine. you might also find in the future that this turns out to be useful for you and that's fine as well. what i'm trying to say is that this is useful for many others (and i believe i have provided enough evidence of this), while not breaking _your_ existing workflow. i'm not trying to convince _you_ that this will change your life. what i have trouble understanding is your opposition to something that can clearly benefit many people while not impacting you at all. from a utilitarian perspective, it is a clear-cut improvement - it has an upside and no downside. and no, i don't thing requirink a simple upgrade to cmake counts as a downside - if you do, i guess we just agree to disagree here. everyone has to have cmake installed and updated anyway. i probably wouldn't even have considered submitting a pr if the changes i proposed implied telling a bunch of existing contributors/team members ""hey, remember how you used to do things? well from now on you'll have to do it this way"". a big selling point of this pr imo is that no one is forced to do anything any differently. you keep centering your argument around ""my preferred way of doing things is not difficult, so the others are invalid"". this is very obviously not about sufficient mental faculties. of course anyone could do it your way. it's just that clearly many people _prefer_ to do things another way. the reasons for this can be various, and if the implementation does not impact you negatively, why stop it? for example, consider the case of users who are involved in many different projects - they might not wish to deal with an env var jungle in their systems, and might prefer to have each project more self-contained rather than have them leak stuff to the system's environment. or even just dealing with environment variables at the project level - some just appreciate the convenience of not having to fiddle environment variables, the build system does the tedious work for them. now this is an instance of an argument that _does_ require ""formal proofs""/hard data to substantiate - extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. the burden of proof is on you to supply profiling data showing how this adds ""a few extra seconds"" (a simple average of three `$ time cmake ...` runs or equivalent should be enough to get started). this is absolutely not something that adds ""a few extra seconds"". this adds a few milliseconds _at worst_. absolutely no one will notice it. again, i believe i've shown how the shortcomings you mentioned are nor really there (except for ""forcing"" you to update cmake, which again, we can agree to disagree on that one). and, more importantly, i've clarified how this does not impact your workflow, while being useful for others and that _i'm not trying to convince you (or others who prefer other workflows) to switch to this workflow_. the thing is, cmake is moving towards making it trivial to do this way. consider that in the new native feature that they are introducing in a future version, the use case i describe is exactly the example use case shown in the documentation: [a link] this is convenient for many people. as for non-trivial logic: again, once cmake releases the new version with the `target_runtime_dlls` genex, it will be possible to significantly simplify the code. you can be sure that i will submit a pr doing just that once that is possible (although you'll probably block it until vs/qt includes the new updated cmake version... seriously man, just install it the regular way...). i wish i had a good example at hand of how this in turn makes installation easier from some experiments i made, but i can't seem to find them right now... regardless, you'll be able to see it once i submit such a pr... for now, feel free to ignore this argument about ""making installation easier"", my above points stand on their own just fine and are enough to justify this..",-1,1,1,0.464534044265747,0.9379803538322448,0.9618554711341858,1.0,accept,majority_agreement

439601585,9824,"sorry for delay. guys, let's define the policy of using qasconst/copyasconst once and for all. 1. **(lvalue)** we require to use qasconst when we iterate over non-const container but we don't intend to modify its items. however we can safely use it even with const containers to be sure that further code modifications will not lead to unexpected detaching of shared data. 2. **(rvalue)** copyasconst is a more expensive operation because it calls the copy constructor (although it is quite lightweight). when can it really help? only when affected method returns copy of internal container. when method creates new container it isn't affected by ""detaching"" problem. now i'm not sure that using copyasconst is the best solution. it generates either unnecessary copying or requires awareness of the internals of the affected methods (i.e. we need to know exactly what it returns to decide whether to use copyasconst or not). maybe just drop it and use another approach?",-1,-1,-1,0.98918354511261,0.98313707113266,0.9846085906028748,-1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

107176578,2892,i finished with the whole pr. now you can fix/answer my inline comments and we're good to merge. i want to ask(or note some general observations): 1. what happens if a user closes qbt before a magnet has downloaded its metadata? how do we restore that magnet? 2. why do you create a file lock for the resume folder? did you notice problems without it? 3. inside `session::addtorrent_impl()` we should initialize `libtorrent::add_torrent_params::file_priorities` directly from `bittorrent::addtorrentdata::filepriorities` and not after the torrent has been added to the session. 4. i propose using lowercase names for namespaces to differentiate from class names. plus i propose the `bittorrent` namespace become `bt`.,0,1,0,0.8473278284072876,0.5451148152351379,0.5550919771194458,0.0,accept,majority_agreement
108232454,2892,"this can be divided into two different cases. 1. if we add magnet with dialog and the user closed the program (or system crash) before loading the metadata, we do not have any way to fix this, because the torrent has not yet been added to the session. 2. if we add without dialog (or what is the same, clicked there ""ok"" without waiting for downloading the metadata), then the torrent is added to the session and we have to resume, even if it has no metadata. now this is not yet implemented. i plan to do this later. i have an idea - we can save magnet uri in fastresume file in that case, if the torrent hasn't metadata, and then (when you resume) use this if there is no torrent file. in the previous code we had to check for the existence of this folder each time it is accessed. now we are sure that it exists throughout the program. it would be nice also lock the ability to change access rights, but i don't know how to do it. i wanted to do it, but for some reason i thought that such a possibility should be kept in `libtorrent::torrent_info` (through which i made a preliminary renaming files), but couldn't find it there. thanks for the tip. done. technically, **class** = **namespace** + **struct** + etc. so i see no reason to apply different naming. usually, lowercase namespace names are used where it is customary to call all in lowercase (for example, in libtorrent). i prefer not to use such a naming scheme. however, if you insist, we'll change that. at the expense of **bt**. not good to use acronyms and other abbreviations in such names (even the names of the variables, except for some simple cases, should be as informative as possible). exceptions can be only some well-known abbreviations (e.g., utils, fs, misc, etc.) or too small reduction in long words, do not interfere with the perception of their meaning. if you care about the enter code screen space, then (trust me) it's not the greatest evil (especially now, in the era of big monitors). this is my (and not only my) opinion on the matter. the final decision for you. the only request is if we change it, it is easier to do it in a separate commit (i was so tired from rebasing). i finished all the fixes. if there are no additions here, i will update the pr. waiting for your answer.",0,0,0,0.845518171787262,0.8489620089530945,0.8767784833908081,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

[a link] seems to be deprecated on later versions. i think its better to use [a link] instead. 2. why use getmodulehandlea() instead of getmodulehandle() ? 3. user visible strings should be wrapped in the tr() macro. `qstring tmpstr(""please wait while qbittorrent is exiting...\nbe patient, it could take a while..."");` should be `qstring tmpstr(tr(""please wait while qbittorrent is exiting...\nbe patient, it could take a while...""));` however i am not sure we should include a linebreak in the translatable text. translators might remove it. there might be some other syntax improvements possible but i don't want to dwelve into those. i'll do them myself after i merge this. do you have anything to add?",0,1,1,0.6701456904411316,0.863807201385498,0.4667705595493316,1.0,accept,majority_agreement

69798928,2389,"как я уже говорил - праздники кончились, а вместе с ними и свободное время... но нам надо разобраться с этим до конца. осталось немного математики и здравого смысла. ну, во-первых, все-таки поборемся с излишней универсальностью некоторых функции. таких у нас три - processlist, processhash и processmap. делают они одну и ту же операцию, но с разными типами данных (а именно, сравнивают два объекта одного типа и вычисляют разницу между ними). самая основная идея здесь в том, что мы должны оперировать не с некоторыми абстрактными qvariantlist, qvarianthash и qvariantmap - у нас это лишь способ представления, соответственно, списка простых данных, списка структурированных данных и самих этих структурированных данных. не менее важно и то, что внутри функций сравнения мы имеем два объекта, можно сказать, одного класса - если это структуры, то они имеют одинаковый состав, а если списки - то они содержат элементы одинакового состава (это ведь логично - мы же не должны сравнивать, например, торрент с чем-то другим). и вот что следует из вышесказанного: 1. проверки типа `!prevdata.contains(key)` в функции `processmap` не нужны, так как `data` и `prevdata` имеют одинаковую структуру (т.е. одни и те же ключи). 2. проверки типа `prevdata.isempty()` в функции `processmap` также не нужны (и по той же самой причине) - даже если мы будем сравнивать пустые структуры, то они будут пустыми обе, и все отработает правильно и без этих проверок (цикл просто не начнется). 3. описанные в предыдущих пунктах проверки актуальны для `processhash`, т.к. здесь мы сравниваем два списка, а они могут содержать разное количество элементов или быть пустыми. но (это чистая математика) `prevdata.isempty()` здесь никак не зависит от цикла и поэтому ее нужно перенести за его пределы (чтобы не делать одно и то же n-е количество раз). это же относится и к `processlist`. что еще можно сказать об этих функциях... функции, имеющие выходные параметры должны быть спроектированы так, чтобы они инициализировали эти параметры (т.е. вызывающая сторона не должна об этом заботиться). в нашем случае достаточно просто их очистить. получается примерно следующее: [code block] p.s. просьба оставить комментарии в функциях. те комментарии, которые перед функциями, нужно разместить перед их предварительным объявлением.",0,0,-1,0.6388563513755798,0.941803514957428,0.4739780128002167,0.0,accept,majority_agreement

[code block] jackett's torrenturl and link attributes change every single time an rss is requested. if i set an autodownloader rule and it downloads an item it will not be marked `""isread"": true` on completion. this causes the downloader to redownload the article when there is a qb restart. for some reason i do not understand this only happens on a qb restart, in other words, it remembers it has already downloaded the article in the current qb process. i have 2 suspicions: 1. it could be the `id` attribute, note that most rss lists use the hash for an `id` while jackett uses a url link (a jackett limitation). maybe a variable type problem? 2. qb uses more than the `id` attribute to determine if an article should be marked `""isread"": true` (which it should not). i suspect it could use the feedurl as well, and since the feedurl change constantly this could be interpreted as a new item. also, jackett links cannot be magnets because of the way it works so this could also be the culprit. i did some digging and these 2 blocks of code look where this is happening in rss_autodownloader.cpp i do not know the language so please forgive any errors in my assessment.

1007922008,15452,"since mentioned his annoyance by the ""complaints about a couple of extra clicks, unless it is something that is really often used"", let me discuss why i used to use the ""download in sequential order"" & ""download first and last pieces first"" options in the context menu very often. of course, while i think that my use case is reasonable, i don't know how common it is, but let me explain it anyway as a data point. when adding a torrent of a media file, i usually select ""download in sequential order"" in the add torrent dialog, in order to be able to preview the media file to make sure it's correct, ensure its quality etc. once enough of the file is downloaded and i previewed it, i turn off the ""download in sequential order"" option to let it download most optimally for the swarm. occasionally, i find that the media file also needs the end of the file to open, in which case i select the ""download first and last pieces first"" option. i don't select it in the add torrent dialog for all torrents, because often it is not needed, and it can take a long time in slow torrents and delay being able to preview the file, especially since #3816 significantly enlarged the percentage to be downloaded at the end and there is no option to decrease it. so i used to use these two options at least once for *almost every single torrent*, often twice, and sometimes more. this change, which makes it more cumbersome to change these options, encourages me to leave the torrents at downloading sequentially. #164 has a lengthy discussion of why that might be bad. so i was disappointed to see that qbittorrent 4.4.0 pushes me to bad behavior for the health of the swarm, in addition to make things more inconvenient. also, i am less likely to notice that i left the file downloading sequentially and i should change it, since now this information is hidden in the torrent options dialog, whereas it used to be always in-my-face as it appeared as a check mark in the context menu. in any case, i don't expect this change to be taken back, and if any options were to come back to the context menu, i guess those are more likely to be the category option or maybe set location action, as they seem to be getting more complaints (#15946, #15965). since the other two are unlikely two come back, i would at least love to be able to open the torrent options more quickly, with a hotkey, as i mentioned in this issue: #15980",-1,-1,0,0.7820946574211121,0.7999741435050964,0.69073086977005,-1.0,accept,majority_agreement

68630769,2332,"i will try to describe what i understood from the plan of . and just complement it by my comments. i will write in english and russian, to more accurately understand what i mean. proposes to implement a completely different web api based on data synchronization between the host (qbittorrent) and web clients (you can call it web sync api, whereas an existing - web query api). this will work as follows. in some key points (usually, at the first request and on network errors, causing the loss of transmitted data), the client receives a complete copy of all data and saves it. it only asks for the changes that have occurred since the previous request and updates its copy of the data. sorting and filtering of data is performed on the client side. proposes to create a query `json/webuimaindata` (i think you can just `json/syncdata` - this will reflect its essence). but better, in my opinion, if we further differentiate between existing and new api, providing new **scope** to it - `sync/data` (or `sync/maindata`, if it is necessary to conduct separate sync some parts of the data). in this case, **scope** for an existing api can be renamed from `json` to `query` (it happens, for example, `query/torrents` and so on). я попытаюсь описать, что я понял из замысла . и сразу дополню это своими комментариями. писать буду по-английски и по-русски, чтобы все более точно поняли, что я имею ввиду. предлагает реализовать совершенно другой web api, основанный на синхронизации данных между основным приложением (qbittorrent) и его веб клиентами (можно назвать его web sync api, тогда как существующий - web query api). это будет работать следующим образом. в некоторых ключевых точках (обычно, при первом обращении и при сетевых ошибках, приводящих к потере передаваемых данных) клиент получает полную копию всех данных и сохраняет ее у себя. в последствие он лишь запрашивает те изменения, которые произошли с момента предыдущего запроса и обновляет свою копию данных. сортировка и фильтрация данных происходит на стороне клиента. предлагает создать для этого запрос `json/webuimaindata` (я думаю, что можно просто `json/syncdata` - это будет отражать его сущность). но лучше, по-моему, будет, если мы еще больше разграничим существующий и новый api, выделив для него новый **scope** - `sync/data` (или `sync/maindata` на тот случай, если придется проводить раздельную синхронизацию некоторых частей данных). при этом, **scope** для существующего api можно переименовать из `json` в `query` (получится, например, `query/torrents` и т.п.).",0,0,0,0.8841925859451294,0.8568533658981323,0.8631880879402161,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

44770317,1703,"hey i think i have better/simpler interface of the alert dispatcher in mind. how about this: 1. dispatch() checks the type of the alert. if it isn't a `state_update_alert` it puts the alert into a queue (eg vector). 2. the readalerts() in qbtsession continues to operate in a fixed timer based approach. 3. each time the timer timeouts readalerts() requests the whole queue(like it does now) from the dispatcher via the getpendingalertsnowait() function. now because we want react almost instantaneously to `state_update_alert` we cannot wait for the timer to timeout. the dispatcher should have signal named `torrentupdates` or `statusesupdates`. in qbtsession constructor we do something like this `connect(m_alertdispatcher, signal(torrentupdates), slot(handletorrentupdates(const std::vector &)), qt::queuedconnection);`. then dispatch() instead of queueing this type of alert it will `emit torrentupdates`. according to the qt docs, when you connect the signal in this manner it is guaranteed that the slot will be called in the main thread even though the signal was emitted in another thread. this way you avoid the extra logic of event_posted and enqueuetomainthread() (and possibly other details). at his point, if i understood correctly the code, a signal is a emitted when every alert is received which isn't very desirable. we should queue them. ps: also the `stats_alert` may need its own signal to handle it almost instantaneously too.",0,0,0,0.9447263479232788,0.9296674728393556,0.8740900158882141,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

564712175,11637,"these changes are suggestions from my experience with using qbittorrent ""in the field"". the numerical values, in particular, don't have a bulletproof justification, it's just a ballpark. the idea is to optimize defaults for the common case, where it is understood that ""common case"" now also includes users with relatively fast connections (50+ megabits to 1 gigabit, my condolences to any australians or americans reading this) and machines (with ssds, and the like). the goal is to do this without raising the minimum requirements to run qbittorrent with several torrents too much (i think the main concern would be memory usage). of course, as always, users at either extreme end (ultra fast machines and connections, machines dedicated to high speed seeding, racing, or users with very low available memory and other system resources) will need to tune their settings for their specific use case. i would appreciate comments about all of these potential changes, but especially relating to the `watermark*` ones. does the memory consumption of these settings increase proportionally to the number of active torrents or peers or is there a single send buffer for everything? if it is the former, then at least the value for `send_buffer_watermark` is probably unreasonable and wasteful for everything except the fastest connections. additionally, how difficult would it be to detect the number of hardware threads on a system at runtime? i ask this because, like i said in a previous discussion, i think the default value `aio_threads` should be changed to be `4 * number_of_hardware_threads`. the reason is that libtorrent will spawn 1 sha-1 thread for every 4 `aio_threads`. nearly all systems will perform better, particularly when rechecking, if libtorrent spawns as many sha-1 threads as there are hardware threads available. nowaydays most people have machines with at least 2 cores (laptops) or 4 cores (desktops), and many people have more than this. with `aio_threads` set to 4, libtorrent will only ever use one of them for sha-1. but that is a matter for another pr... i would appreciate guidance, thanks",0,0,0,0.7847767472267151,0.9376870393753052,0.7111980319023132,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement

581908157,11637,i think these would be reasonable target values: - 8 -> 200 mib (same as now) - 12 -> 250 mib - 16 -> 300 mib - 24 -> 350 mib - 32 -> 400 mib - \>32 -> 512 mib i don't think it makes sense to fine tune too much for more than 32 gib since: a) it is already a huge amount b) libtorrent 2.0 will probably come around way before systems with >32 gib ram become common place among the majority of the user base (whereas systems with 8-16 gib ram are already common now). thoughts?,0,0,0,0.5650818347930908,0.9698433876037598,0.9545825719833374,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement
582027341,11637,i think the current method should be kept **as is** but with the addition of below: a new tier(s) at 8gib/16gib or 32gib there should probably be a max upper limit cap for the manual setting of the disk cache setting too. (just like the outstanding memory when checking torrents is capped at 1024mib) should manual disk cache setting only have a range up to max 1024mib?? this would fall under the **current** calculation: * 32 gib ram: 32768/40 = ~800 mib,0,0,0,0.979420244693756,0.9892224073410034,0.982273280620575,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement
