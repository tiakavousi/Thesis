174968760,4996,JosephMcc,2016-01-26T11:56:04Z,i had my first chance to try this out. i use a dual monitor set up and ran into issues right of the bat. not sure if you have the hardware to test by i started a branch here: [a link] it contains a fix that was preventing panels from being loaded properly on all monitors. the other commit is just clean up to bring it more in line with other cinnamon js code and make it a bit easier to work with. feel free to grab the changes for your branches. the other thing that i see just looking through the code is how style classes are handled. currently you are using completely different classes when an applet is horizontal vs. vertical. instead of doing that use add_style_class_name('vertical') and remove_style_class_name('vertical'). the advantage to that is the vertical applets will inherit all the styling from the normal ones. if you need changes you can just override the specific properties you want to change. make for easier/cleaner theming. these warnings: (cinnamon:2738): st-warning **: did not find color property '-arrow-background-color' (cinnamon:2738): st-warning **: did not find color property '-gradient-start' (cinnamon:2738): st-warning **: did not find color property '-gradient-end' are caused by the specific theme you are using and not caused by your code.,0,0.5600688457489014

(arch linux, fedora, and linux mint are all binary distros, and would no doubt be equally interested in engineering a new feature in a manner which is usable by a binary distro.) if we're talking philosophy, failure to support graceful runtime detection of features is exactly what leads to dependency management nightmares and exponentially increasing repository sizes. if your selinux rules are forbidding cinnamon from opening up libnm's gobject typelib *but only when cinnamon is built without the networkmanager use flag* then maybe those rules suck and should be better designed to not be ifdef'ed based on a use flag. either way i would expect said selinux rule would prevent the typelib from being opened, thus preventing networkmanager from being used, thus being no different from building without networkmanager support at all.",0,0.6806171536445618

298142894,6486,itzexor,2017-04-29T02:58:36Z,"ok, dug even deeper. the reason we are receiving a `glib.error` as the message, is because those errors do not have a `stack` property. our error logging code expects every error to have that property[1], if it doesn't it's treated as a message. i don't see a clean way out of this one... the most effective, but probably dirtiest, method i can think of would be to somehow ensure all errors that make it past cjs into user code (from cjs's perspective) are js native errors. this is dirty as hell, and i'm not sure if it's even possible. it would probably require all kinds of different error type handling code, and would make us diverge more from upstream. another fix would be to change iserror() to return true as long as it has a message, and fix logging in main.js to properly handle errors without a stack[2][3]. this would touch almost every logging function inside main.js from what i have seen. one way this could be done is to use a helper function wherever we are grabbing the stack that would return an error's stack if it exists, or create a new stack trace (and somehow intelligently clip the useless last few function calls). i have hacked together a partial implementation of the second method there. it does work, and the messages are displayed as originally intended in extension.js[4] and then appletmanager.js[5], but i don't like this solution so i'll wait for any better suggestions or just leave everything as is for now.

1978295906,12100,fredcw,2024-03-05T09:18:43Z,"yes, i guess that this is the crux of the matter. if it's not going to be adopted by theme devs then then this pr doesn't really serve any purpose. i guess it's also a bit of a chicken and egg situation, theme devs can't adopt it if it isn't implemented. since the button only appears if a theme supports it, it would make no difference to the settings>themes gui with themes that don't. maybe it would be worth a try and if it isn't widely used then it could be removed again at a later date. i guess there's only really one way to find out. the idea of using it with mint-y, mint-x, and mint-l themes was just an afterthought, and having considered it, it's impractical. this idea was only really about 3rd party themes and as you say, there is already a way to select options for the mint themes. the problem of course is that it only works for mint themes and can't be used for 3rd party themes. well fluent theme has 7 different things to configure and the cinnamox theme variations in the repo for instance, mainly change the background color, and with the last theme uploaded to the repo, the author says he has variations in the gradient fill on panels. yes, that's the current situation and i agree that that probably won't change much. but i think that an unmaintained configurable theme is still probably better than an unmaintained non-configurable theme. i think that they would think that writing a gui app for the options would be too much effort. i've also written the options.py program which basically does the same as this pr but has to be included in the theme directory and run from there. my thought is that providing this would make adding theme options easier and may encourage adding theme options. with cinnamon themes uploaded to the spices repo, maybe a gui in cinnamon like this is exactly what is needed to make theme devs think it's worthwhile implementing configurable options. yes, libadwaita is a problem. it seems to me that there are a few ways to deal with this. 1. do nothing, which means that people can't theme libawaita apps except manually which is the current situation. and unthemeable libawaita apps defeats the purpose of theming. imo. 2. what i've done with this pr - make it easier to link libadwaita to the current theme (if the theme supports it) and to easily remove the theming if wanted. unfortunately, if libadwaita is to be themeable at all then there's no way around this. if you were to change to mint-y then there's no way to theme libadwaita to mint-y anyway except by using the command line. if you still have the theme installed that you linked to libadwaita then hopefully the user would remember that they used that to theme libadwaita and would think to use that to untheme libadwaita. and in any case, they still can't theme mint-y to libadwaita. (btw, if the theme that libadwaita is linked to is removed, thereby leaving broken links in `~/.config/gtk-4.0`, libadwaita automatically reverts to the default adwaita theme.) 3. ~this i think is the best option though i don't know how to go about implementing this: perhaps in cinnamon settings deamon, the current gtk theme could be monitored and when changed, cinnamon checks to see if the current gtk theme has a gtk-4.0 folder that appears suitable for linking to .config/gtk-4.0 and if so, automatically installs links, otherwise remove links. that way, whenever the current theme ""supports"" libadwaita (including mint-y), libadwaita is automatically themed to it, otherwise it's set to the default adwaita theme. i don't think people would want to theme libadwaita differently to gtk3 any more than they'd want to theme gtk4 or gtk2 apps differently to gtk3.~ so i agree, the libadwaita situation is not ideal but giving the option to theme libadwaita for some themes is at least better than nothing. in any case, this feature can be removed if necessary. edit: it turns that a gtk4 theme has to include specific support for libadwaita, not just gtk4 so this 3rd option wouldn't work.",0,0.7976043224334717
