""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". so the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""original language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". see also this is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checklanguageaccess. similar problem we have in the ""list view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. permission check in tcemain is more ""aggressive"" than in the gui. correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has ""edit permissions"" on the ""pages"" table - just like tcemain also does. as this is confusing for integrators in general, i would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on ""language restriction permissions on pages"" in the first place before fixing the gui. i am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but i am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5. maybe in your research you find out different aspects than i did or you can prove me wrong as i have only touched the ""surface"" of the whole complex. please let me know!",-1,SentiCR,
