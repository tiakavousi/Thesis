1719210795,5439,thanks for your great contribution! i think we should add `identifier` in `package` as well as `detectedvulnerability` since it is an attribute of the package. what do you think? it means purls should be generated in the analysis part. [a link] purl can be generated here for language-specific packages. [a link] os packages may need to generate purls in each analyzer. [a link] please let me know if you have any comments.,1,1,1,0.9889742136001588,0.9899797439575196,0.9943218231201172,1,accept,unanimous_agreement
