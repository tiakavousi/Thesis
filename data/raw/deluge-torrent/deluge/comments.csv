1004610739,331,DjLegolas,2022-01-04T08:26:43Z,"Looks great, thanks.
If you can, please add a job to the CI for automatic creating the installer. It will need to have the ability to compile everything it needs (GTK3, OpenSSL, etc.)."
1004613096,331,doadin,2022-01-04T08:30:56Z,"@DjLegolas 
I'm working on that atm. The hardest part kind of is compiling GTK. Others have public windows builds. Could use a build host for this but artifacts don't last forever. And GTK takes quite a bit of time to compile."
1004642179,331,doadin,2022-01-04T09:17:01Z,"@DjLegolas
The best option would probably be to have a build of GTK hosted somewhere then use that plus the already available builds of others eg. just pip install libtorrent and use prebuilt openssl from the ci host, as most things are available or easy to get like with pip, GTK is the only thing really hard to get."
1004646414,331,cas--,2022-01-04T09:23:35Z,"@doadin I agree if we can start simple with dependencies the better, where needed we can modify it later to suit.  For GTK we could fork the gvsbuild repo and create releases or store them on deluge ftp, either way we want a simple reproducible process."
1004650915,331,doadin,2022-01-04T09:30:20Z,"@cas-- Yes I plan on on making an CD github actions, since that seems to be what we are using for other things, that will making an installer using prebuilts from github actions image, which the only thing I see needed out side of that is GTK ill make the script to use from appveyor since thats where im currently setting up a build, should be a easy change in url to a different host depending on where you would like to get it from."
1004690840,331,doadin,2022-01-04T10:27:07Z,"@DjLegolas @cas-- 
It seems that github actions uses powershell to run so I added a sample CD.yml based on that which should only need a correction for the URL where we want to get GTK from. The deluge spec file already has path setup to be able to find openssl and such so unless the wheel of libtorrent from pip requires something else should be able to find all the deps deluge needs.

Edit: also the path to gtk may need editing all depends on how we get gtk and how the zip for it looks and is extracted and so on. Again though should be a fairly easy edit of the spec file to make any correction for how the build environment is setup. Appveyor and github actions (maybe others) seem to put openssl and such in the same location so should be pretty easy to make work any where really.

Also I made the sample only build on pushed tags so any time you want to make a release should be as simple as adding a tag. We could maybe build for PRs too or something but you guys can decide that."
1005092640,331,DjLegolas,2022-01-04T19:05:44Z,"BTW, great work @doadin 🥇"
1005310000,331,doadin,2022-01-05T01:42:24Z,"@DjLegolas  @cas-- I think I have addressed the points you guys have brought up, still uncertain about nsis use again I'm not very familiar but I think other than it being cleaner its at least close to proper syntax?"
1005380653,331,doadin,2022-01-05T04:50:34Z,"@DjLegolas @cas--  So im really stuck its apparently not able to load a dll for gtk, which I have no clue. I have the spec file setup to add GTK\lib folder and the VC redist to path but its still missing a dll from somewhere idk."
1005426388,331,DjLegolas,2022-01-05T06:50:55Z,"@doadin - don't worry, we will help you with that.
Seem like there are several dlls missing:

1. python - `No such file or directory: 'c:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\python\\3.7.9\\x64\\DLLs\\'`. Maybe it's on another location or name?
2. make sure that the GTK lib and bin paths are in the PATH environment variable so the the python libs will find them."
1005450228,331,doadin,2022-01-05T07:40:34Z,"@DjLegolas 
1. I did a print of the dir and that dir does exist not sure why it says it doesn't. (side note: do wish we could have rdp to the vm like with appveyor.)
2.I am using pathex in pyinstaller to add the GTK lib and bin paths. I could try and add it in the build script vs pyinstaller adding it but should work from pyinstaller.

1005455759,331,doadin,2022-01-05T07:51:31Z,@DjLegolas I tried adding the GTK dir to path from the github actions and still no go. I wish I knew what DLL it can't find would be probabbly really easy to find if I knew what I was looking for lol.
1005530462,331,mhertz,2022-01-05T09:45:04Z,"Really stupid question, but doesn't help using x64 gtk(for x64 build) ? It's seemingly through bindepend.py/pefile.py trying check a file related to gi(hook) , which links to gtk dlls, running matchdllarch on them, or something. Strange error regardless. As said on forum, the pathhex is irrelevant, atleast on real system, with that spec(mine atleast), when in PATH as djlegolas said, just to not waste time on adding there this and that. Anyway, really impressed, looking great, thanks a bunch for all the nice work :) 

Edit: I'm sorry, just looked more at the commit, and see the gvsbuild zip states x64 in name, but I just thought it was x86 because added panthex's lists e.g the standard gvsbuild paths for x86 builds, not standard x64 ones. I apologize for noise, and please disregard, as if having the x64 paths in PATH env-var, then fine(I'd change them regardless, spec pathex's I mean, if not completelly ditching them all).

Edit2: Before that issue, then cannot even import gi module, making breakage later on presumably, so should look into that and not the missing dir/dll(s) later reported, as byproduct of that presumably. Cannot import _gi module from gi - have you checked pygeoip installed correctly in python I.e can you import it / _gi* file in site-packages/gi?

Edit3: pygobject, not pygeoip lol :) The gtk3 python bindings wheel produced by gvsbuild. "
1005838989,331,doadin,2022-01-05T15:43:36Z,"The script installs pycairo and pygobject from wheel from gtk build folder and is ""successful"" so I see no reason why it would not be available. I could be wrong but I think the missing dll isn't a product of missing gi but other way around it tries to import gi which tries to load the dll which fails ending in the importing failing."

I believe https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/runs/4711875889?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:107 shows us that at least partially gi is installed. And that it fails to import because of missing dll.

Edit: again maybe I am wrong but if gi module was not installed it would be a name error or something like that not a dll error?"

Anyway, I remember during looking through cmd output during mine builds, that it stated sometimes, probably unrelated, looking for ctypes in DLLs, though not specially for gi, but saw there where a ctypes pyd in that DLLs folder, so maybe check if there, if possible, though strange mentions dir not found in error, when there. Sorry for noise and I'll butt out now - best of luck you guys :) "
1005874174,331,doadin,2022-01-05T16:23:33Z,@mhertz I never turn down help/ideas. :)
1005882953,331,mhertz,2022-01-05T16:34:15Z,"Thanks mate :)

Just very quick, seemingly is issue of gdkpixbuff hook tries to find path to gi library dir it gets the wrong one and fails colecting any pixbuff-loaders - it tries to do a dll check I think, but cannot on a folder, as the error just mentions folder not file.

Anyway, I got this from looking closer at the output and googling it, where issue with little other, but slight related, very slight but regardless - It was stated that e.g. the user having issues had poisened his build environment by having gtk3/gdk dll's in current folder or next to script or something, messing that part up.

A suggestion was to check if can see the path correct by adding in spec file, just for troubleshooting... well, you can see yourself what to add, a single line printing it to cmd during freeze - I didn't yet read it through, so possibly better hints later, and again sorry if way off:

https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6282
 
Edit: No need add in spec, sorry, just states to check in python from where running pyinstaller normally. Here gets the correct:

C:\\gtk-build\\gtk\\x64\\release\\bin"
1005895701,331,doadin,2022-01-05T16:50:47Z,I have a theory I am testing now. Normally I believe when you install gtk python bindings you end up with a struckture something like python/lib/site-packages/gnome/gi-repository I just made a build attempt and made it print out the site-packages folder and the gi-repository which I believe normally has libs in it only had like 1 file and was a __init__.py or something like that. Im thinking maybe for some reason the wheel is incomplete. Im currently running a build on my test VM to see the folder structure.
1005898284,331,mhertz,2022-01-05T16:54:03Z,"When installing pygobject, then always makes gi dir under site_packages and bunch other gi dirs there. Indeed if only a __init__.py, then the issue as per error, as the _gi*.pyd not there, which tries imported - so the install of wheel went wrong, or incomplete as you state. Good catch, sorry for my ramblings before."
1005901327,331,doadin,2022-01-05T16:57:43Z,I'm trying to run a test suggested in that github issue and see where it is looking for the lib then we can check that folder to confirm if the files needed are there or not.
1005902679,331,mhertz,2022-01-05T16:59:23Z,"The gi regardless is f'ed up - you need a _gi*.pyd there for import, and i'm pretty sure that's the root cause(if you say there only is a init.py under site_packages/gi). But sure, test that out.

Again unless its not actually the GTK libs we are missing and it is looking for msvc dll's or something to which again it would be helpful if it told us which dll it is looking for and not finding so we could add that dll's dir to our path.... but that would make this too easy I guess..."

1005990595,331,cas--,2022-01-05T18:51:51Z,"@doadin Nice work, much appreciated :tada: "
1005993344,331,doadin,2022-01-05T18:56:07Z,"since this is really close now a few things to note going forward
1. Depends on gtk artifact from appveyor/zip file that has the structure like so:
    gvsbuild-vs16-x64.zip/release/bin
    gvsbuild-vs16-x64.zip/release/lib
    etc etc
2. the pyinstaller spec file is coded to a set deluge.ico path specific to github actions checkout
3. I don't know how to use nsis command line args to make nsis produce different installers for x86 vs x64
    why was this needed? I had two nsis scripts to change the installer file name so we can provide x86 and x64 installers without confusion of which a user downloaded. and it changes the default install location to ""program files"" for x64 or ""program files (x86)"" for x86
4. Currently the gtk build artifacts are built using vs 2019 and python 3.7 so I used python 3.7 in the CD action and the cd action has hard coded locations for python which idk if actions/setup-python@v2 provides a variable to get pythons path so we can use that instead to make the builds less python specific or what?"
1006001076,331,doadin,2022-01-05T19:07:52Z,"@cas-- something I can change now is do we want the CD to run on pull requests so we can verify changes easier? Or just on tags?

Do we want to make github releases?"
1006067051,331,mhertz,2022-01-05T20:50:17Z,"Very quickly while you're messing with it anyway, then as per my last edit on forum-thread, using 'pip install .' like deluge official instructions states, followed by 'python setup.py install_scripts', fixes deluge-console working again(freezed I mean), and is more proper installed anyway, without double deluge package folders(one egg one normal, mixing up). I noticed you don't include hidden_imports for gi and cairo, but I guess you've tested that this isn't needed - was previously, but maybe not now with added spec-additions. Btw, I tested spec also runs fine in packaging/win32 folder(if shipped there in feature), also icons support relative path in spec btw. 

You don't have to answer, I know you're busy, but just so you don't need read through my way to long edits on forum about this :)

Thanks again.

Edit: Yes, hidden_imports for gi/cairo not needed, and sorry realized it was pretty dumb thing to state anyway, after previous long conversation about gi importing issues, doh, but I didn't knew if that option did more than just extra impports, sorry.

Edit2: Last thing, instead of in deluge instructions having user add '--distpath xxxx' additional option to pyinstaller, then can add it to spec, e.g. like I just did in mine, I just set to 'freeze' of cwd(packaging/win) like instructions. I btw changed the analyze code to avoid need import sys when os already imported and does job fine, though not important: https://paste.c-net.org/BeccaCharming (emulate --clean would need delete build folder I guess, I don't really see why, but regardless)

Anyway, disregard and concentrate on the important stuff of-course :)

Edit3: Very last, promise - Just wanted to end with uploading my final spec, where I added the ""--clean"" code, the ""--noconfirm/-y"" code, and ~50MB savings from unneeded icons(gi hook copies all from share), I didn't touch locales as didn't neither in unofficial installer I see. https://paste.c-net.org/MoralsPleasing"

Greetings

*Sorry in advance for this off-topic, but I couldn't find any other way to ask your opinion directly.*

I'm so glad for the ongoing development of Deluge, and I've been constantly wondering: why not enabling Issues and Discussions in this repo? And, also why not migrate issue tracker from Trac to GitHub? 
I believe it would help in getting more attention to the project and more people to actively contribute in Deluge's development.
I made this thread in the forum [[Suggestions] Make use of 'GitHub Actions' + Migrate issue tracker from Trac to GitHub](https://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=55442) 2.5 years ago, but never got a response from a dev. How do you find this idea?

I currently have a github action for GTK setup to target 3.8 which should be ready to copy over if you want to. And it should be easy to change the deluge CD action as well now. I think you have test run on 3.8? Looks like python supports each new version for +1 year from the last and 3.8 is supported till 2024 so that could be a decent target. I see deluge code was updated to work with 3.10 though so we could go for newer.

@doadin For the windows build I am happy with almost latest Python version e.g. 3.9. We want something that is stable and not outdated as you mentioned. If it's easier to stick with 3.8 then that is perfect with me :+1: Obviously Deluge needs to support much older versions so it's Python 3.6+ now"

@DjLegolas @cas-- 
They use github actions but don't release builds. I was building on AppVeyor but switched to github actions so really if you fork the repo you can go with either. AppVeyor build process doesn't make github releases only AppVeyor artifacts. The github actions I updated recently so it will make a release on tag, Downloading that release I'm not sure of a better way other than just downloading from a url.

Nothing custom to it really just skip a few thing we don't need to build, could also be more things we don't need to build but that I'm not sure of."
1007603473,331,doadin,2022-01-07T17:45:03Z,"@cas-- The github action I have for GTK currently build on any tag and now has two strategy matrix.
`
          - platform: x64

          - platform: x86
            vs_ver: 16
            pythonversion: 3.9
`
And the end result is a github release with two zip files in the format:
gvsbuild-pyPYTHONVERSION-vsVS_VER-ARCH.zip

the deluge build will download w.e. url and name the file GTK.zip so only the url has to change there when we want to use a new build(unless we wana rename the zip to something more generic and upload to deluge ftp or something). I also updated the script to scan for GTK python wheels so we no longer have a static pycairo and pygobject wheel which includes version and things now it will just find them and install what/if it finds any in the gtkbuild/python folder."
1007696999,331,doadin,2022-01-07T19:58:48Z,So it appears if you re-run a build the release with delete the old and upload the new so the url doesn't have to change with using github releases for GTK. Alternatively  could use something like https://github.com/dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset to just download the latest release.
1007900819,331,DjLegolas,2022-01-08T07:18:05Z,"@doadin @cas-- I think we can build everything for py3.6-3.9 (don't know if py3.10 will work, not to mention 3.11), and libtorrent 1.2 and 2.0.
It all depends on GTK to be built for all of the python versions (and it look like @doadin is already compiling it to 3.7-3.9).
As a result, we will have every supported python version with every supported libtorrent (still a WIP :sweat_smile:)

The difference is only in the `matrix` section in the `cd.yml` file:
```yml
matrix:
    pythonVersion: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    libtorrent: [1.2.15, 2.0.5]
    arch: [x64, x86]
    include:
      - arch: x64
        wheel_arch: amd64
      - arch: x86
        wheel_arch: win32
```
And the GTK zip download link was moved to the `Install Dependencies` section (the only place it is needed) as follows:
```yml
GVSBUILD: ""https://github.com/doadin/gvsbuild/releases/download/1-7-2022-5/gvsbuild-py${{matrix.pythonVersion}}-vs16-${{matrix.arch}}.zip""
```
In addition, need to change the artifact zip file name like so:
```yml
name: my-artifact-py${{matrix.pythonVersion}}-lt${{matrix.libtorrent}}

It's a valid point, and it is you decision at the end 🥇.
Some think points:

- create a libtorrent2.0 variant which will be always marked as testing release, up until we finish with the fixes for it.
- add the matrix for the CI phase, and test on all supported python versions (>= 3.6), also on LT1.2/2.0.
- @doadin - change your `CD.yml` file for gvsbuild, for better and shorter file, to: 
   ```yml
    matrix:
        pythonversion: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]

The build process seems to work with anything python 3.7-3.9, except for with 3.7 & 3.9 the end exe's give this issue:

From what I read this was due to a change early on in 3.9 which now seems maybe backported to 3.8.(googleing gives a lot of results from people saying 3.9 issue, went to 3.8 and its fine) I changed the build back to 3.7, after trying 3.8 and 3.9, and its working fine."

Anyway, that's old as said, and I posted better solution later, so unneeded. Also as said, for fixing deluge-console, and to follow general best practise guide-lines, imho consider installing through 'pip install .' or alternatively, if must use setup.py, then I checked works through adding install command '--old-and-unmanageable', or alternatively what pip does, and use '--single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt' to setup.py.

Last, the excludes you added won't work, and will need e.g what I did I.e folders not supported there. Took me a bunch of tests to get working, though never claimed being the brightest neither :)

Just noticed you messed with the pathex/datas additions. Again, amazing work all around!"
1008222380,331,doadin,2022-01-09T03:33:48Z,@mhertz Unfortunately in github action environ its not picking up the x64 dll for openssl even though its in the os PATH environment variable. 
1008293597,331,mhertz,2022-01-09T13:01:34Z,"doadin, quick note just, hope okay. I wanted to look into the stuff you mentioned regarding newer python's making issues, so just started doing little testings. I always thought probably being issues when going to py3.8 and above(but wanted wait to if you maybe asked for help regarding it), tbecause in unofficial installer I had to specifically code into __init__.py os.add_dll_directory(dir),well used *.pth initially but regardless, because of changes in how python worked in those versions, to avoid dll mismatch I also was plauged with initially with bug-reports by forum-users before py3.8. I wasen't sure if would work anyway for you, without mods, because the gvsbuild devs included os.add_dll_directory into __init__.py's of pycairo and pygobject after I raised that there where newly introduced issues, and one of the devs explained me the pitfall, and made/comitted fix still there i.e. checks PATH for needed gtk dll's and add the dirs found into os.add_dll_directory. There can still then be mismatches, because some have dirs in PATH from other apps, with said dll's, or in system32 with incompatible versions, completelly breaking deluge(system32 takes precedense always, before this os.add_dll_directory change introduced, saving me from lotta trouble at the time), so I in my scripts/builds(unofficial installer) patch that out of __init__.py of pycairo/pygobject and in deluge's __init__.py I hardcode the bin dir of gtk , which I included in app dir, as only call to os.add_dll_directory happening, as if keeping the pycairo/pygobject's __init__.py's and add mine infront or some other place, then the docs state it cannot promise load order of multiple os_add_dll_directories, hence I did it that way just in case. Anyway, I suspect you need openssl location in os_add_dll_dir, but if having it next to the libtorrent.pyd under site-packages, then works regardless, so I just had my scripts(unofficial installer) copy the two built openssl dlls to there, but could also be copied to gtk bin dir as included in os.add_dll_dir if not patching out the mods by pycairo/gobject, or if override and doing it yourself like I did. Forgive me for having a problem explaining stuff shortly :) So, initially deluge couldn't import libtorrent, even unfreezed with python 3.9.9, but after copying dll's in place next to libtorrent.pyd, works, and gets picked up through freeze because is next to the libtorrent pyd, most likely would also have worked if copied to gtk bin dir, but whatever.

I'm thinking this possibly is your github-actions openssl freezing issue also, because maybe messed with newer python's when happened, Sorry if wrong, but regardless, wanted to say that works for me atleast with my first test of py3.9.9, just waiting for freeze to finish(so PATH for openssl not enough for even unfreezed, is my point, on py3.8 and up - also with deluged not even loading the __init__.py's of pycairo/pygobject as not gtk app).

Okay finished freezing, and fails loading deluge because error stated in gi's __init__.py as paramter incorrect for add_dll_directory it states - as said it by default enumerates PATH for cairo/gi libs(cairo.dll) and adds those found to os.add_dll_directory, which on clean system is bin dir of gtk, but that is failing now - maybe pyinstaller sets up a fake environment, where such isn't allowed i.e. parsing through PATH, or using other dll's outside freezed dir, and regardless shouldn't work like that freezed obviously anyway. Regardless might work if patching that out and using e.g. my deluge __init__.py, or some other trick, but i'll check it out and post back when progress. This must also have been brought up with pyinstaller in general before i'm sure, but didn't look it up yet. Sorry again for wordyness. Last, why it's not breaking before(under py3.8) with wrong parameter error, is that it check if os.add_dll_dir attribute available, and if not skips, in __init__.py of pycairo/pygobject, so first time using that section from there now, as upped python version, so attribute available.

I'll make some testing and will make edits when hopefully finding something that works, and try to keep short, unless you beat me to it with solution of-course - and sorry haven't looked at your latest commits, so hope you haven't already fixed, and i'm speaking redundantly here. Thank you.

Edit: Okay some progress atleast - my first handfull tests failed for some reason, but for now atleast, then I just kept the default pycairo/pygobject __init__.py contents under site-packages gi/cairo of unfreezed deluge-install, and added two lines to each of them, I found by googling it, by one of the gvsbuild devs on pyinstaller bug-tracker, not the one I talked too initially which added the patching, but anyway, and he had issues with a frozen gtk app, because of the gi __init__.py gvsbuild patches, and he posted a few lines as workaround in end, which worked and I used here. In short there's added ';' after your PATH, can only be seen in cmd(echo %PATH%, and not in advanced system settings/env-vars), and this makes the PATH parsing trip up(in pygobject/pycairo), so the added code removes that semicolon at end, if there, and so I now finished a py3.9.9 freezed build semingly working, only checked deluge.exe but still, without errors shown. If finding more later, when time, i'll add. I don't like the PATH parsing still, as point of breakage, though i'm not sure how much pyinstaller bootloader/strapper allows interference from outside regardless, or if maybe first the freezed dir takes precedense anyway, so no concern - I did rename the gtk and openssl dirs on system, so wasen't working from PATH anymore, and then still worked, so not sure that even is used, and anyways as said, freezed dir probably takes precedense anyways, so maybe OK in end here.

I added:

if os.environ['PATH'][-1] == ';':
    os.environ['PATH'] = os.environ['PATH'][:-1]

Just over 'added_dirs []' in both __init.py's of pycairo/pygobject, as only change, and had installed deluge through 'pip install .' and 'python setup.py install_scripts', before 'pyinstaller deluge.spec', with my spec, and openssl's there also..

Edit2: I reported it to gvsbuild here: https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/issues/475 - didn't make PR as maybe they want to do it differently, I dunno. I'll do some tests later when have time, to see if the current pygobject/pycairo contents(the old one) is a point of failure in freezed app i.e. I add non-compatible cairo.dll or whatever else referenced into system32 or alike, and see if used and breaks or not, and if not, then can just use as is, and apply patch untill upstream fixes it I think. Your choise of-course. I haven't tested all exe's yet, so do that also, later when have time, and then will report back, for last time in this :)"

As said, I think ran 50 runs to even get that working, though probably an issue with me more than anything else. But it doesn't help filtering a.datas, when we have b-h.datas with those icons anyway, getting merged at end - maybe could do something with toc(), but I just got tired of it when having found something working. It goes through all collected files for each step, x.datas, and ""rewrites"" it through checking if matches with the excludes filter, and if not, then adds, and if matches, then strips/avoids - reverse filtering of sorts. No biggie of course, and i'm sure could be done better, e.g. the straight datas, like on top, but couldn't make work. Also, maybe Cas/you think it's too agressive I dunno, only found it worked as far as could see myself, and has svg decoder in gdkpixbuff loader through librsvg so why include all the pngs additionally, but what do I know.

Thanks :)

Edit: Just read your previous link - I had only read github homepage, with the pip direction, sorry.

Edit: Well, probably could avoid the for-loop on the scripts not using gtk atleast, as guess no icons collected, but just didn't bother at that point.

Edit: I had openssl dll's as said in lib\site-packages, next to libtorrent.pyd, copied there by old habit, and so got picked up for me in freeze, but if not having that, then as not in gtk3 dir which gets added to os.add_dll_directory from pygobject/pycairo, then cannot find, as PATH irrelevant on py3.8=+ so instead of copy over like I do, then could add such os.xxxx call to spec, but you have added something yourself fixing it you said, I honestly haven't looked at your spec yet, but no need then, as you found solution, good job.

Edit: As said, I haden't yet tested all exe's, though most i.e. deluge, deluge-debug, deluge-gtk, deluged and webui. Now I see deluge-console don't work, but i'm guessing it's not that hard fix, but well see.

Maybe I missed something.

Edit: Also using ""working"" there isn't exactly true deluge-console loads but freezes and becomes unusable.

leave https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/commit/d0cf01ed573b0e92e532d0b500b2c89bcdd3a3a8 here as last working build so I can keep track."
1008353776,331,mhertz,2022-01-09T18:51:56Z,"doadin, i'm sorry, when I said ""working"" I meant in the previous py-versions - I did say that I haden't tested all exe's yet in py3.8=+, but sorry if formulated badly - probably - sorry.
.
There are some strange issues - first deluge-console seemingly works if after installing deluge unfreezed, then also installing windows-curses - that didn't need happen on <py3.8. Then when that is installed, then works, I think, need test more, but shows some initial error about libintl and referenced before assignment, also deluge-debug states such - though seemingly works - I just think need intl dll and whatnot other dll in main dir, that I used to copy there with unofficial installer, but will take a look.

Last, atleast unfreezed, then now have deluged showing window open all time, like the debug.exe should - I remember having this issue along time ago, and got patches by tobbez fixing this, so maybe needed here again, I dunno - hmm, no I didn't use such in last unofficial build - now i'm getting confused, will write back later, and sorry if making issues for you doadin, didn't mean to.

Edit: The issue with window staying open, is a bug in deluge I believe, and need fixed, I have the patch-""method"" by tobbez, I didn't see it because use alternative exe loader and not stock, and edits shebang to pyw version, so think that will need changed, and should be reported, just hate making PRs as no programmer, just slight tinker, and no issues section on deluge well bug-tracker on trac. Anyway, i'll test some more, and sorry again, I didn't remember these issues.

Edit: I'm sure you know, but deluge-console only work non-interactive on windows, or atleast used too - so I always tested cli args."
1008357929,331,cas--,2022-01-09T19:17:47Z,"I'm sorry I'm finding it very hard to keep track of these conversations so helping out is tricky. 

Can we try and keep a track of exactly what is working and what is not and be very specific about each issue and what the potential fixes are. Also when making commit updates it would be useful to actually see what and why changes are being made rather than rebase to single commit. It might also be useful for workarounds in the code to have terse comments about what is being fixed.

@doadin would you mind updating the list of tasks remaining in the PR description and tick them off as done. We can then decide if they are a priority or not. 

We want a minimum viable stable installer for Windows therefore don't need to chase latest versions:

* If there are too many issues with Python 3.9 then don't work on it, use Python 3.7. 
* We only need to verify that the `x86` installer works since it's compatible with `x64` thus concentrate on that. 
* I would also prefer if we used libtorrent 1.2 rather than 2.0 again for stability
* I don't think reducing the installer size is a priority and can come later

@mhertz Please provide a bit more information on error and fixes by providing traces, code snippets and links to files. 

Avoid sharing links to issues that are not github.com since those are sham sites making money via ad revenue e.g. giters.com and also the linking between github issues fails.

Py3.9.9 with my spec and install, has no issues in freezed version as far as I see now.

In unfreezed is having issue of reporting intl dl translation issuel, but works, though as kinda off-topic here I guess, when not in freezed, then I didn't post output, can on request.

Only thing is that the freezed deluged works because I defined console=false in spec - bit it ends in py, not pyw, so default windows exe loader/wrapper loads through python.exe not pythonw.exe making cmd window open in unfreezed- again I guess of-topic as not in freezed.

All 8 exe's tested working.

Deluge-console only works non-interactive, for me, in all my tests, both here and in unofficial, and in ""real install"".

Spec used: https://paste.c-net.org/BethesdaTermite

I add unfreezed errors just in case, but again, no issue in freezed version.

I don't think anyone really minds help but I had a build that worked only thing not tested was deluge-console which didn't work in deluge 1.3.x anyways so imo not a huge lose(hard to lose something you didn't really have as far as most users are concerned). The only thing really needed is deleting the requires.txt not really a big deal imo. Nothing done here has to hack/slash gtk or exe loaders or anything.

@cas--

"
1008363687,331,doadin,2022-01-09T19:58:56Z,"I think the only reason why the openssl dll addition is needed in spec is because of the mass amounts of programs in Path that have a version of those dll's. So we can leave it as is, or I can reduce the Path env in script to only include dirs we need. Either way I think a change is needed and the one we have isn't that bad. Not my call though I'll do what ever.

The errors I posted in unfreezed was fixed in freezed because intl.dll was in the gtk-dir added through os.add_dll_directory() and gets included in freezed main-dir. 

Btw, in your gvsbuild-scripts, could use something like:
````

1008531262,331,doadin,2022-01-10T04:17:33Z,"@mhertz I havn't had any issues with the build scripts, however if we wanted we could use that first patch idea applied to the .spec file to add the openssl-x64 dll's to build and remove the 32-bit ones maybe. And that could maybe be a less peticular system dependent change unlike my check for if running on github actions."
1008534575,331,mhertz,2022-01-10T04:24:35Z,"Yes, try that - I thought I would need an os.add_dll_directory addition in spec for including openssl, but didn't need it for some reason.

I don't understand why you don't need patch the pycairo/pygobject, as is the thing that breaks deluge on py3.8+, unless you have no semicolon in PATH ending(echo %PATH%) - and from the error you posted yesterday, I believe you have. 

Regardless whatever you can make it work with :)

"
1008535804,331,doadin,2022-01-10T04:26:55Z,@mhertz I think you hit the nail on the head there I think its a OS Path setup issue not a gtk issue.
1008539434,331,mhertz,2022-01-10T04:37:09Z,"I have also openssl dlls without 64 in name in my freezed dir, didn't think you where talking about that. This means that pyopenssl from python got seen and imported with deps, and not the x64 we build ourself only for libtorrent's usage - we need both, or else e.g. yarss will break.

Edits: Good idea about that trick could be used, sorry for being dense.

* Bundles the extra missing vcredist file during freezing i.e. msvcp140.dll, so runtimes should be okay/ticked-off.

* For me, the specifically thing solelly that controls if x64 dll's pulled in, is:
````
tmp_ret = collect_all('deluge')
datas += tmp_ret[0]; binaries += tmp_ret[1]; hiddenimports += tmp_ret[2]
````
Short spec example, just to see dll's(for me): https://paste.c-net.org/TootsCovet

(Deleted too much talking before...)

* I think you use that already above, but also I use homemade openssl x64, but if you use premades, then maybe those you use are not linked to/importable - e.g. built different like with/without asm or something? Dunno... Can check with premades later when time e.g. shinning.

* Yes, I can reproduce your issue, from installing openssl-x64 from shinning, and selecting yes to the default install prompt of copying the x64 dlls to system32. Then fails pull in x64 dlls from spec. When manually deleting the two x64 dll's from system32, then works again, despite there also being x32 versions there still, which I didn't delete. If not deleting them(x64), then even breaks my own home-built openssl from pulling in. Light shinning package(as used in github-actions VM's) or full, doesn't make a difference. As is temporary VM(github actions), then just delete the system32 x64 files before firering up pyinstaller in your setup, i'm thinking."
1009597871,331,doadin,2022-01-11T04:52:37Z,@cas-- The opensll dll's it is picking up is in fact a x64 bin it is just not named as such. How we want to deal with this im not sure. However if we just name them as libtorrent expects we don't need that line in spec file.
1009611929,331,doadin,2022-01-11T05:26:56Z,From my testing I believe pyinstaller is picking up the dll from C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\3.7.9\x64\DLLs which despite being x64 does not include that in the name. From testing I see that in that folder for x86 and x64 the name remains the same simply libssl-1_1.dll. It also appears openssl 1.1 is used from python 2.7-3.9 newer versions may use a different openssl version I'm not sure.
1009655516,331,doadin,2022-01-11T07:07:16Z,Using a dependency walker it shows only x64 dll needed yet if lib(ssl/crypto)-1_1.dll is removed it fails to import libtorrent. This must be a pyinstaller issue I guess?
1009782011,331,cas--,2022-01-11T10:00:23Z,"@doadin Thanks for looking into this, I like that fix. We should let libtorrent know about this too but might be tricky to resolve without breaking it for someone...

> It also appears openssl 1.1 is used from python 2.7-3.9 newer versions may use a different openssl version I'm not sure.

As long as we document it, we can revisit the issue"
1009785135,331,doadin,2022-01-11T10:04:10Z,"@cas-- yea a dependency walker shows the libtorrent.pyd as only needing the x64 so it might actually be a pyinstaller hook maybe? I'm not sure.

Edit: what I think is the build process is picking up a 64bit dll on its own.  And I'm guessing whatever process makes the libtorrent wheel links against an x64 named one and if it didn't we would likely be fine."
1009917154,331,doadin,2022-01-11T12:27:25Z,"If we change:
cd.yml:

* Metadata needs patched only because missing metadata, both in ""requires.txt"" issue of py3.7, and ""metadata"" of py3.8+, and avoided entirely by in spec adding said metadata back through:
````
datas += copy_metadata('deluge', recursive=True)
````
* I made PRs at gvsbuild + upstream, but untill merged, then can add yourself, if deemed neccesary. It breaks deluge starting if in same dir as deluge and having trailing semicolon in PATH(only seen from 'echo %path%'), as some installers add - test e.g. from freezed dir:
````
set path=%path%;
deluge
````
https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/issues/475
* deluge-console works only non-interactive on windows, just like deluge 1.3.x, sorry if thinking I ment all worked(though Cas says it should now though).
*  Unimportant, but the openssl without x64 comes from python itself/pyopenssl(and needed for yarss2 etc to resolve https), and the x64 named is for libtorrent, so no pyinstaller/libtorrent issue(should report to python to fix there unusual naming). Good job fixing by copying over! As said, deleting the x64 from system32(or whereever interferring at your end), plus full collect_all line in spec, also fixing this, but better way from doadin imho.
* If ever finding more files missing/issues, then use the collect_all for deluge line from docs I always did, though currently doadin's way is better, as saves 1mb install size.

1012311605,331,CirnoT,2022-01-13T16:42:25Z,"I have not checked the version that adds `hiddenimports` from `Twisted`, however can we be reasonable sure that plugins such as YaRSS2 will work? For example, YaRSS2 for v2 depends on `http.cookies` via `requests` and `email.mime.*`. Both of these are part of stdlib for Python and are presumed to be always available, however pyinstaller does not treat them as such and produced binaries might not have necessary modules available.

This was an issue with v1 too, back then YaRSS2 had its own custom code for `email.mime.*` part for Windows users, however since release of v2 it started to depend on various 3rd-party modules such as `requests`, which bring their own dependencies that plugin does not necessarily control. To my knowledge they've done best job they could trying to package these external dependencies into egg they provide, however of course Python's stdlib is out of their control.

---

The other issue that remains is how broken GTK3 is on Windows. Seeing some weird issues where clicking Deluge icon on taskbar does bring window to front but doing so again does not minimize it as one would expect. Using `GTK_CSD=0` is a solution to this (and many more). We should of course never modify user's environment globally when installing Deluge, so the question remains whether there is some way we can have Deluge disable decorations when running on Windows without relying on environment variables.

---

In addition, do we want to also rebase this PR for 2.0.5 so that Windows users can have a stable release? 2.1 introduces some breaking Python2 related changes that will again require attention from some plugin developers so we might want to port back some of the fixes that @cas-- pushed to 2.0.5, make it a 2.0.6 release and push a Windows installer with it, while work on 2.1 continues. For reference, even without these fixes 2.0.5 is very much usable using this PR, however I only tested it as thin-client so YMMV."

Yes. If its possible to set environment variable for executable via `runtime-hook` in pyinstaller than that would be solution.

> Edit: Always been somewhat leery though, as stated to possibly have a performance penalty, didnt notice any though, but hard to judge, when only quick testing.

Less performance on drawing items is in my opinion preferable to broken interaction with Windows DWM.

> but my understanding was that it wasent global and only enherented for running proces, and not transferred. Wrong?

I am not sure where you set it. Environment variables are usually either set when running process or globally for user/computer (in which case it would apply to everything). If as mentioned above `runtime-hook` can do it for pyinstaller then it would indeed be isolated.

> Can you more specific about Python2 breaking changes? I probably will have to create a 2.0.x release branch anyway so certainly possible to release 2.0.5/6 for Windows.

Some plugins (in this example YaRSS2) still retain some level of compatibility for Python 2, even on releases that are meant for Deluge 2. See https://bitbucket.org/bendikro/deluge-yarss-plugin/issues/67/deluge-210-removed-all-py2-support for details. The common offenders will most likely be `PY2` (from `deluge.common`) and `six` (if plugin decided to use it, but unlikely).

Perhaps we could keep PY2 as a dumb stub (`PY2 = false`) to make plugins happy?"

Ideally we would package all standard modules, so that there is no difference between available environment for Windows and Linux. Python 3.10 would make it easy with `sys.stdlib_module_names`, however as we need to target lower versions, we'd need to come up with some small hook for pyinstaller that enumerates available modules (some options are on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6463918/how-can-i-get-a-list-of-all-the-python-standard-library-modules). We could also produce a static list for versions below 3.10 (and use `sys.stdlib_module_names` from 3.10 onwards) and provide that as hidden imports directly.

For reference, here is full list of available modules for Python versions between 3.7 and 3.9 (note that some of them will not exist depending on version used, for example `'graphlib', 'zoneinfo'` were introduced in 3.9 while `'macpath'` was removed in 3.8):

Appreciated to know, however non-stdlib requirements are something plugin developers must solve themselves, otherwise users are forced to take manual steps (like you did), so this is not something we can accommodate when packaging Windows version.

Yea, you'll want to mock out session.pop_alerts() and session.wait_for_alerts(). You can check out how we did it in spritzle for an idea: https://github.com/spritzle/spritzle/blob/master/spritzle/tests/test_alert.py

The `split_host_port` function needs improvement and simplified. 

- Use `host` not `ip` as variable name in the function to keep consistency. 
- Start by setting the two variable to `None` and then the last step of the function is `return host, port`
- The tuple is implicit for returning multiple values so can drop the brackets.
- If you can't extract a port then at least pass back the `host` value with `port` set `None`.
- Use int not float for port.
- Docstring should be google style.
- Use `str.partition` to get ipv6 host and port.
- A better descriptive name than `paste` for the string parameter.

1029047587,359,gazpachoking,2022-02-03T14:30:33Z,"Hmm, that's a good point and I hadn't fully thought it out. Here were my goals:
1. Have the IDE know what stuff was when I'm refactoring. (I have several branches where I'm trying different stuff, and the IDE rarely has good type info at the moment.)
2. Define the contract a bit better for exported methods, so it's more apparent if they get changed. (Once again, I was thinking more how pycharm automatically highlights wrong usage/returns more than running an explicit type checker.)
3. I don't think it would be terrible to enable mypy checking in the loosest mode, where it only cares about the things we have already documented, such that type hints could be added bits at a time.

That being said, point 1 is probably not so applicable to the exported methods, because they normally get used via client, or via component.get(), both of which the IDE loses track of the type hints.
And 2 is probably better served by the docstrings, so it gets exported to the RPC docs. I do like the expressiveness of the type hints compared to just a simple type in the docstring, (e.g. List[Tuple[int, str]]) but in cases where the requirement is more complex it needs to be spelled out in words for the generated documentation anyway. If we did want to move to this style type hints, we could make it the single source of truth, and just make the docstrings for people https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/ (this would be my vote.)

I still think the type hints are quite useful in the IDE for autocompletion, and I'd be inclined to add them to any bits I touch when doing any fixing/refactoring, unless you are against them completely. For more internal methods the disadvantages above are moot."
1029056574,359,cas--,2022-02-03T14:40:06Z,"I had forgotten about IDE usefulness so happy to try to accommodate there, just didn't want to have the types to become outdated or spend a lot of effort for little gain. 

Personally I find type hints can reduce code readability and unless constantly encountering type issues not worth the added overhead, especially if never fully verified by mypy.

Since we already have a form of typing in the code, I am happy if we experiment with moving types from docstrings. As you suggest starting with core exported methods and use [sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/)."

I'm not quite sure I understand what you're trying to say, or if you understand what you're saying yourself.

Running a project like this is a huge amount of work, and if there is one thing you can do to help, it is to contribute in a manner than helps the developers the most.
Dumping a zip archive with your changes has never been the way to contribute to a software project ever since patches become the standard. The fact that you even bother to quarrel about this suggest you don't know enough about software development to be in a position to suggest anything at all about how any developer should accept any help at all.

If you need help with creating a PR, you should be clear about that, and maybe someone will help you. 
Saying that Cas won't accept zip archives due to wanting money is ridiculous.
Suggesting shit like you did is not the way to behave, and deserves am apology IMO.
If you tried something like this e.g. on the linux dev email list you'd be told to fuck off."

2 points I think I should bring up:
* `resume_data` can be fixed even further by skipping it when coping the `alert`, just like all of the `__x__` methods.
* when fixing the `url`, I learned that there is a function to parse magnet uris - [`lt.parse_magnet_uri()`](https://libtorrent.org/upgrade_to_2.0-ref.html#magnet-links). The return value is an `add_torrent_params` object which can be manipulated just before passing it to the `lt.add_torrent()` method.
 I think we should consider using it at also in https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/blob/e75ef7e31f3a8befd6365acbf8b7ebbb774bb5e5/deluge/common.py#L755

We should not use any libtorrent method outside of core since we should not require it to be installed if using a thin client.

> about upgrading to lt1.2.14 as the minimum version 

As I said we should not put a high hard limit on the lt version so leave it as 1.2.0 unless there is a critical issue we know Deluge is not compatible with. It would be up to package managers to ensure using latest stable versions of libtorrent "

1021521347,343,DjLegolas,2022-01-25T19:14:10Z,"> I'm not sure what you mean here, can you elaborate?

Sure. In [`alertmanager.py`](https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/blob/e75ef7e31f3a8befd6365acbf8b7ebbb774bb5e5/deluge/core/alertmanager.py#L126), we are coping the content of each alert as it arrives as it will be deleted by the caller.
When we receive an alert of type `save_resume_data_alert`, one of it's members is the deprecated `resume_data`.
As part of the copy, we access `resume_data` as well, which triggers the `DeprecatedWarning`.
A possible solution, it treat it as `__x__` (just an example):
```python
alert_copy = SimpleNamespace(
    **{
        attr: getattr(alert, attr)
        for attr in dir(alert)
        if not attr.startswith('__') or attr != 'resume_data`
    }
)
```
The ""correct"" way, according to libtorrent [1.2 upgrade guide](https://libtorrent.org/upgrade_to_1.2-ref.html#resume-data-handling) (last line), is stop compiling LT with deprecated functions enabled, but it's not part of this PR.
 
> We should not use any libtorrent method outside of core since we should not require it to be installed if using a thin client.

I agree. 
Also, passing it from the core to the thin client is not that important and efficient.
Dropping the suggestion.

> As I said we should not put a high hard limit on the lt version so leave it as 1.2.0 unless there is a critical issue we know Deluge is not compatible with. It would be up to package managers to ensure using latest stable versions of libtorrent

Keeping `1.2.0` it is.

Just to add what's missing there, then I just found out NSIS adds ""Start in"" for it's generated shortcuts into target dir, effectively making people hit the pyinstaller and trailing semicolon bug I previously posted about(on py3.8 and up only), but I didn't knew before today that it is windows adding trailing semicolon to PATH(more info on gvsbuild post), so pretty much most(all) should be affected(unless maybe if having old install before change introduced), and that the generated shortcut from deluge installers uses said ""start-in"" - I tested building installer, install, and couldn't start from desktop shortcut, with error message posted about wrong parameter.

If not wanna rebuild, could also just use something like this in mean time(change paths accordingly), before firing off pyinstaller:
````
(Get-Content c:\Python\Lib\site-packages\gi\__init__.py).replace('if os.path.isfile', 'if p != """" and os.path.isfile') | Set-Content c:\Python\Lib\site-packages\gi\__init__.py

The change to gvsbuild-release was already commited, all that's missing is for the workflow to run, which is only on a manual trigger. However, that would break the current CI. The idea would be to run it just before this PR is ready to be merged. "

I know and I was inquiring about it as well a while ago. Thing is, even if that's fixed, I doubt we'll get retroactive releases for an old version, so the point stands in that we need to be able to 1) update libtorrent and 2) have at least some CI workflow that fails anf alerts us when newer versions break, because else we're putting ourselves in the same position the folks at twisted did, which is essentially forgetting it's an issue.

Of course, I'm willing to help however I can but I have essentially no experience working with libtorrent so I'm not sure that really amounts to much.

What do you think @DjLegolas?"

                                 Sets the default UI to be run when no UI is specified

Currently seeing this:

I know that using subparsers means we cannot add them to the UI parser group so may need to do something similar as described here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32017020/grouping-argparse-subparser-arguments

So if `positional arguments` can be renamed to something more meaningful, moved closer to UI options and include in the description that UI args can be passed as well...

401489689,196,DjLegolas,2018-06-29T22:30:23Z,"I think I didn't explain the problem correctly.
The script will take time to run, but it's not the problem we have.

When the test run, it starts the WebUI with `self.deluge_web.start()`. The expected behavior is the ability to connect to the server itself by connecting to it's IP and port - `127.0.0.1:8999` and being able to use it. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

When connecting to it with a web browser, firefox and chrome, there is no response from the WebUI at all. All you get is a message that the server is down.
Connecting with `openssl -s_client -connect IP:PORT` only shows `CONNECTED(*some-code*)` and the handshake process being stuck after the 1st phase, `CLIENT HELLO`. A good connection will show the important info about the secured connection, like public cert, protocol version and agreed cipher. 

BTW, this testing library looks cool..  I'll check it out.

**EDIT**: Now I understood what you meant... I'll create a test with both `testssl.sh` and `tlsfuzzer` and verify which is faster."
402473793,196,DjLegolas,2018-07-04T13:06:40Z,"Ok, I've implemented the tests using `testssl.sh`. This effects the duration of `pydef` and `trial` to be completed.

In addition, Not all tests currently passes as a further configuration is needed for `Twisted`:
* `Client-Initiated Renegotiation` needs to be canceled.
* There is no `server cipher order` for the daemon.

Finally, some of the tests are for `http\s` servers, so whey are being skipped.

I didn't use `tlsfuzzer` because it's still under development, has no documentation and doesn't compatible with an automated test-run."

It can be done, but this will extend the running time of the test as we need to download 2 files, `testssl.sh` and `etc.tar.gz`, and extract the later (or download everything from its [repo](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/releases) and then extract).

Actually, I just realised that the code should be downloaded by travis instead in `install` section. Tox is for setting up a python test env so we should specify in the documentation that testssl.sh is a requirement.

Use whatever is the simplest way to install the files, using the releases seems like a good idea. 

To deal with the time penalty I intend to only run these security tests either manually or with commits on the `develop` or `master` branch. So not PRs or other branches. Another idea so you can run them in a PR is to include something like the word `SECURITY_TEST` in the commit message."

I think it's probably worth it in the long run if I can get things cleaned up a bit more. Right now it's a mix of manually redone tests that are nice, some things that I change only just enough to work, and some in between. I have found multiple cases of tests that were broken, (passing, but not testing the thing they thought they were,) and even some where the thing they thought they were testing was broken.

2 things...
1. Is there any quick way to get the connected server hash ID?
I want to get its version number, but can do so only with `deluge.client.web.get_host_status`, which requires the server ID...
2. Do you know who controls the bots of github and trac on IRC? They are both out of the main room and, therefor, no info is shown when publishing stuff."
427680511,204,cas--,2018-10-07T19:37:23Z,"1. The `host_id` is not readily available other than parsing the `web.get_hosts` for `host_id` with `connected` status. If you are looking for the version then using the rather obscure RPC method `client.daemon.info` returns the version of the currently connected daemon.

2. If you mean drizzle bot that's a deluge service that I maintain... I haven't been on IRC recently so didn't notice that need to be registered to join the channel now. The bot is now registered and hopefully will spam the channel once more ;) I think the github one was gazpachoking's but that's just a guess."

I'll take a peek at that.

I'm thinking given these issues, maybe the nicest compromise is to make a decorator that calls ensureDeferred, and wrap any converted functions in it, just like we would with inlineCallbacks. It wouldn't give us all the advantages of async/await, but it would ensure full compatibility with everything existing, while letting us use that syntax within the wrapped functions. I don't think that method has any disadvantages compared with inlineCallbacks either."
1023818698,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-28T02:11:20Z,"Okay, I added the ensure_deferred decorator, which will let us keep using the wrapped async functions as normal functions returning deferred. I'm investigating whether there's something clever to do that will dynamically remove the wrapping if called directly from another async function, but it might be a bit too magicy, (or not work at all,) we'll see."
1023903263,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-28T05:36:42Z,"I may have just created a best of both worlds situation. I modified the `ensure_deferred` decorator to only call `ensureDeferred` in situations where the function was not being used like a coroutine function. This means in works exactly like an `inlineCallbacks` function, _unless_ it is called from within another async function, in which case it acts like a plain coroutine. This means in areas where we've converted the whole chain to async functions we'll get nice tracebacks, without breaking compatibility with places still using legacy twisted deferred syntax.

I'm really quite excited with this solution, but it probably needs a bit more testing before I can tell if there are any weird idiosyncrasies that make it sub-optimal.

@aresch @cas-- How do you feel?

example:
```python
@ensure_deferred
async def test():
    print('something')

@ensure_deferred
async def outer():
    await test()  # This works
    test()  # This also works  (☉_☉)

d = test()  # yep, works here too
d.addCallback(someotherfunc)  # totally fine
```

1023906260,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-28T05:44:55Z,"Hmm. Might be some issues still. Gtkui doesn't seem to be working.
EDIT: Oh, that might just be from importing reactor too early and having the default one installed instead of the gtk one.
EDIT2: Yep, that was the issue."
1024323283,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-28T15:22:19Z,"I 'm pretty excited about this method, I'm hoping there are no caveats I'm failing to see at the moment. A couple questions though:
- Location: is decorators the right spot to put it? I guess so..
- Naming: It isn't really ensuring the result is a deferred anymore, I'm not sure if there is a better name."

I feel like it's warping the definitions of both coroutines and deferreds into a bit of a mess that might not be easy to reason about.

async/await is just a language feature separate from asyncio. I'm not involving asyncio at all in this PR, this is all still pure twisted. Twisted allows using the async/await syntax, which under the hood works almost exactly the same as using inlineCallbacks on a generator function. https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/16.4.1/core/howto/defer-intro.html#coroutines-with-async-await

Once an async function is wrapped in ensureDeferred, it can feel free to call other coroutines that aren't wrapped in ensureDeferred, as the outer most wrapping will handle the whole thing. This is desirable, because wrapping every level of coroutines in ensureDeferred mangles tracebacks, (not any more than they are now, but that is one of the nice benefits of async/await vs inlineCallbacks.) For us though, since we have a lot of places calling in to our functions, including plugins we might not control, leaving unwrapped coroutines would break any place that called it without the await keyword. The magic I've added here allows coroutines to be left unwrapped by ensureDeferred _only_ in the case where it's being called from another function that already has that wrapping. When used outside of an `await` statement, the ensureDeferrred wrapper is automatically added, making the coroutine into the excact same thing as an `inlineCallbacks` wrapped generator.

I'm still not 100% sure there aren't side effects, I'm trying to trace down the CI failures now to see what's going on with them, but at the moment I suspect it's because I've subtly changed the logic of component.start, and nothing to do with the new syntax."

In this case, it turns into the same thing as running a function that returns a deferred.
```python
@inlineCallbacks
def a():
    yield defer.succeed(1)
    print('doing something')

a()

@ensure_deferred
async def b():
    await defer.succeed(1)
    print('doing something')

b()  # acts exactly the same as a()"
1024617769,352,aresch,2022-01-28T20:37:18Z,Thanks for the clarification. I guess I don't understand why the example with b() is preferable to a()?

A couple things I was shooting for:
1. get closer to a syntax where we could one day switch from twisted to asyncio
2. await is a bit nicer than yield for a few things, for example you can't:
    ```return yield d``` or ```callafunc(yield d)```, but you can with await
2. Improve tracebacks. With inlineCallbacks, (or regular callbacks,) the traceback doesn't show you the line that called `yield a_deferred` as the caller. When chaining awaits, it does.

Of these, 1 and 2 can be achieved by just creating a decorator that calls twisted's ensureDeferred which we wrap any functions we convert to async in. 3 is only achievable when the chained awaits only have the outermost coroutine wrapped. For this, we either need to convert everything at once, including plugins, or use something like the CoroDeferred that I made."
1024642018,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-28T21:17:26Z,"Man, I'm really struggling to figure out what's up with the CI failures. It looks like something happens to the daemon where it doesn't write the localclient account to the auth file. It doesn't happen every time though, and I can't figure why. Also can't figure how my current changes could cause this."
1024655648,352,aresch,2022-01-28T21:29:47Z,Perhaps you could write some tests for CoroDeferred and the wrapper?

I should probably stop making new branches. 😝  Perhaps the usage in those tests makes it more clear what I'm going for, and how it works? I'm sure there is other stuff to be tested, but can't figure it right now. "
1024817640,352,aresch,2022-01-29T03:01:36Z,"Yeah, I was just suggesting it as a way to hunt down any edge cases that may be causing the CI failures."
1024835976,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-29T05:04:10Z,"Man, the converting componentregistry.start is really stumping me. I tried just regular inlinecallbacks and it has the same issue of sometimes not working."
1024844177,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-29T06:03:36Z,"I finally figured it out. The components need to be loaded in a certain order which isn't encoded fully in their 'depends'. I don't know exactly which order breaks things, but when I forced them to go in the same order as before I made any changes to the start function (by making each one depend on the next) it works every time."
1024926487,352,gazpachoking,2022-01-29T14:55:45Z,"And now I think I actually understand _why_ the order is important. The tests wait for the message 'Finished loading' to consider the daemon started. This means only that the TorrentManager component has loaded. It doesn't guarantee that the AuthManager and RPCServer has started, so if the client tries to connect before they have started there are issues.

EDIT: Upon further investigation, it's just the AuthManager not being started before the tests continue that messes things up. The RPCServer actually starts on init, and never needs the component to actually be 'started' to work."
1027599507,352,gazpachoking,2022-02-02T05:28:02Z,"Closing this. I'll do similar refactoring, but on top of maybe_coroutine PR if/when that goes in."

A few minor questions:
1. unit test.
I didn't find anything related to console commands. Based on the naming ""test_ui_console_fields.py"" should cover something, but it's almost empty.
Did I miss something or I just need to write it from scratch?

2. Coding style.

About adding new test, you are correct.. There are no tests for the console ui... So just start one from scratch, and test only what you added for now.

Thanks for the hint @DjLegolas and sorry for the delay with this pull request. I was busy with some personal stuff.

I've pushed the tests to make sure the parser works correctly.
But I'm still struggled with the entire flow test.
I want to write a test which ""simulates"" torrent download and checks that the file was moved in the specified folder.
Once I find a way to do it, I suppose it should be ""enough coverage"".

452417917,228,hukal,2019-01-08T19:15:09Z,"Hi @DjLegolas ,
I've fixed inheritance and naming.
But it looks like I can't find a proper way to make an end to end test.

Things I have tried:
1. Directly call `handle` method of `Add` command.
In this case I'm getting _""ConsoleUI component is not registered""_ error.
Event if I register it (mock?) I can't do anything since `Add` command requires daemon.

2. In `test_ui_entry.py` we have `test_console_command_status` which works with daemon.
I was able to make a similar one to test 'add' command but this command returns only ""Torrent added"" without any id/hash. Due to this fact I can't validate the file in the way it validated in `test_add_torrent_file` from `test_core`.

3. In addition to  point 2 I've tried to run `status` command right after `add` in one method. (I was hoping to grep hash from there). It also caused errors. (Am I correct that current test structure supports 1 console call per method?)

Could you please advise how to test it?

Thanks"
452420910,228,hukal,2019-01-08T19:24:16Z,Build failed but I didn't change plugin configurations...
452908155,228,DjLegolas,2019-01-09T23:26:17Z,"I was trying to implement this myself, and as you wrote - there is some kind of problem.
I'll start with your 3rd point: there is a way to concatenate commands, and it's done by using a semicolon, `;`, between the commands and wrapping the entire phrase with apostrophes.

As for the 1st issue, I agree with you, as it will be best to use the daemon itself.

And now for the final part, the 2nd: 
As I stated in the first line, I tried to solve it too. For now, I wasn't able to solve this yet.

During my many tries, I tried sending only one command. The structure of this command is:
`deluge-console ""add --completed /tmp /some/path/to/torrent/file.torrent ; manage torrent-hash-id move_completed move_completed_path""`

This should have added the torrent and report back the values configured via `--completed` arg.
But I received only the `Torrent added!` message without the info I requested. I suspect the problem is that the `manage` command being processed before the torrent was added, so I tried to split the command into two parts, the add part and the testing-values part. But this gave me some other errors which I wasn't able to solve, yet.

Currently, when running this test, it throws a `ComponentAlreadyRegistered` exception about `ConsoleUI` when reaching the second `yield self.exec_command()` call.

  - The 'Current Filter' text in topbar is not well placed currently and a bit superfluous. It would be better placed in the area aboved the sidebar. In fact even better is if the sidebar is hidden and revealed when pressing `left-arrow`. Something like this:

I don't object to any such changes, however, simply changing to enter in the if test doesn't work, so I didn't look any further at how to solve that. However, it's worth to note that my idea is that, with PR6, it will be possible to have multiple states selected in the filter, which makes sense to use the space key for?
Maybe enter key would select currently marked and deselect any other currently selected?

No, I've fixed and reworked some the help text, but there is probably much left to be fixed.

Yeah, I've reduced it somewhat, but it can certainly be refined some more.

The help text does say ""These daemon connect options will be used for commands, or if console ui autoconnect is enabled."" but I haven't seen any _autoconnect_ functionality implemented for this.

True

Good idea.

* it is not possible anymore to encode and compress in a stream-fashion because the encoded length must be transmitted first (and thus known in advance)

This means clients will be less efficient with transmission of large requests as they will use more memory. It can be a sensible problem for embedded devices and similar use cases (Single-Board-Computers etc).

No, you can start decoding rencoded-objects as soon as one rencode valid ""sequence"" has been decoded, and that does not require the full zlib buffer to be decompressed nor the full rencode message to be parsed.

> The problem observed with the old protocol was that decompression would succeed even if the couple of last bytes of the message were missing.

Do you have a Github issue for reference of this problem? zlib has an Adler32 checksum support (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950), you could have used that."

Yes. But the new protocol only affects a client transmitting to the server, right? When receiving, the prefixed message length doesn't prevent the client from decoding on the fly, if that is desirable?

What exactly do you refer to as a valid rencode sequence? I assumed that referred to a serialized python object (`tuple(MESSAGE_TYPE, REQUEST_ID, PYTHON_DATA)`). In that case, you can't deserialize (decode) only parts of it? And how would that be useful anyways?
Say you're receiving the entire list of torrents (which is the largest message transmitted by deluge server). `rencode.loads` will not succeed until you have all the data transferred for that list. Or am I misunderstanding what you're saying?

> Do you have a Github issue for reference of this problem? zlib has an Adler32 checksum support (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950), you could have used that.

How does that help you to know the length of the transmitted message? You would still need to know when you have the complete message with the checksum at the end?

P.S.
I don't think we used github at that time. There might be some track-ticket."

558381470,224,gdm85,2019-11-25T23:07:01Z,"> Yes. But the new protocol only affects a client transmitting to the server, right?

Yes. The server has always buffered the message before sending, so nothing changed in its implementation (but now even if one would want to rewrite it, it is constrained by the protocol).

@bendikro please note that this was my whole point (with the new protocol client must allocate a buffer for the whole message and cannot stream it down without such buffers), I mentioned it in case it was missed during the design of the new protocol. My tone should not be intended as a report of a major flaw, but as a report of what specifically is no more possible :relaxed: 

> `rencode.loads` will not succeed until you have all the data transferred for that list. Or am I misunderstanding what you're saying?

I was trying to say that at https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/pull/224/files#diff-c3b99fa967416d0e136f56fc09b2c8edR130 (`zlib.decompress()`) a checksum verification could have already happened e.g. `rencode.loads` could only be called **after** the Adler32 checksum verification happened; however it turns out that Python ignores the header that signals the presence of a checksum (those checksum bytes, if enabled during compression, most likely end up in the ""unconsumed input"").

But even without a checksum, look at the python code:
* zlib decompression ends when a `Z_STREAM_END` is found: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/a1ffad07195b8b976f8c371a92028240946d4e76/Modules/zlibmodule.c#L834

A standard-compliant zlib decompressor would return an error (either when using a buffer mode or streaming), give even stronger guarantees with a checksum, and still allow stream-fashioned I/O.

So from what I understood the main problem in [ticket 2116](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/ticket/2116) was calling `zlib.decompress()` on a TCP received buffer which could be incomplete; the new protocol makes a **blocking** read for the whole amount so it will solve this.

However an alternative solution would have been to:
* use buffered I/O
* use a `zlib` decompressor which is strict about truncated input and honours the Adler32 checksum (the python zlib decompressor does not seem to do so, as it is not checking the header bits for it - please correct me if I am wrong)

Would buffered I/O bring back the problem of a ""hanging"" reader? In fact problem is always there if one does not set I/O deadlines, regardless of the approach used for reading. You can probably test for this problem by inserting a random long delay within the first few bytes of the header: without a deadline the receiving end will still hang on the header receipt (note that I have not checked the current behaviour).
When using buffered I/O one would practically set a deadline on how much to wait idle for a `Z_STREAM_END` (relatively to last byte received) before giving up.

I am not saying that it is - now or back then - worth pursuing this approach but I was wondering if it had been considered, as I am generally in favour of more efficient ways of performing network I/O.

Currently Deluge starts by setting only one host however there is no restriction to set multiple hosts in the config for this key and therefore the code changes are not correct since it doesn't account for a list of hosts. Add to the fact that the log.debug output for the `hosts` key should be a list of tuples not a tuple. Therefore this would result in a misleading debug log for the `hosts` key.

Likely want to do something like this:

```
if key == 'hosts' and value:
   # Scrub host password
   value = [host[:-1] + ('**********',) for host in hosts]

and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045 :
```

     attribute := token

     token := 1*<any (US-ASCII) CHAR except SPACE, CTLs,
                 or tspecials>

That callback is nested inside get_torrents_status, so I'm not sure how adding that kwarg makes any difference, it should still have access to the args passed in to get_torrents_status. (my kwarg suggestion was to add a kwarg directly to get_torrents_status, but I'm not sure how nice that is, since it could end up conflicting depending on what pas passed in 'keys' argument.)

The py-GTK wrappers adds the GTK-containing dirs to that call, from searching your PATH, without that it wouldn't even load the GTK-UI(and that is added in through gvsbuild patches, so not available in other methods obtained, manual builds and whatnot), but we still have the issue of the ""core-components""(non-GTK) like libcrypto and intl.dll etc(later tried loaded, before dir added from the py-wrappers(in GTK-dir), hence error's in log - still issue btw).

Either need copy it into ../site-packages dir, so next to the libtorrent pyd looking for it, or add e.g this into ""..\site-packages\deluge\\__init__.py"" or foo.pth file in site-packages(and I use direct path here, just for example):

`import os; os.add_dll_directory(""C:/OpenSSL-Win64/bin"")`

Edit: Sorry, system32 still used(as only thing from old PATH lookup-behavior retained) as Cas pointed out underneath - so still works for finding SSL if specifically using shinning installer and specifically selecting yes to the additional prompt of if wanting dlls copied also to system32 additionally. Bundled/freezed is a non-issue as pyds/dlls all placed into same folder(though my unfreezed bundling needed change from session PATH addition to said os.add_dll_directory addition at py3.8+). "

Sorry I don't really understand much CI yet, so always run local, though same as your yaml, except newest python and few less gtk3 packages etc, but have tested py3.9.12/13 and your gtk3 build instead of mine, before making this PR.

I just did again now too.

I am thinking that the new gvsbuild setup(not running build.py directly anymore), broke that test-run and hence gtk3 and more specifically gi.repository not built, hence pyinstaller couldn't fail with that error. I checked a few jobs at your own repo and in one the deluge exe's was half'ish size, ""tell-tailing"" this(just scanned the log quick and when saw exe sizes, then didn't check more though, yet atleast), and in another run then it stated no log for freeze, though could be retention-rules was stated.

Edit: Doh, I can run CI-runs myself on a fork! You learn something rew everyday! :)

Edit2: Still smaller-exes(missing gtk3 pickup) using this PR(pyinstaller 4.10).

Edit3: Okay I believe figured it out - I locally use another line to install pygobject/pycairo(getting filename with for-loop), though when using that '--find-links' mechanism as your yaml, then gets pycairo right, but not pygobject and tries build from source, which fails here locally, so probably also on your end, so producing smaller freezes because omiting gtk3 because missing py-bindings, and hence neither hitting original issue I raised here, as gi.repository not picked up because of it. I can fix that('--find-links') here later when have time, but then do you still prefer pinning to last pyinstaller v4.x to fix original raised issue, or the ""excludes"" fix for pyinstaller 5.1 I initially suggested?

We should really have all deps pinned in CI to avoid these unexpected problems anyway, I will look to resolve that later.

The part in edit3 I got fixed, so unless you still want pyinstaller v4.9 specifically, then this is latest v4.x and you can see the gst-missing-typelibs I talked about, which continues here in v4.x, but aborts hard in v5.x, hence previous suggested excludes ""workaround"".

220827648,99,cas--,2016-05-22T11:33:52Z,"Just a few points on docstrings: 
- Every line should be finished with a full-stop as they are sentences and makes it clear there is no continuation of the text.
- The first line summary of a method should be on the same line as the triple-quote e.g. `""""""This is a module that...`
- I was discussing this before that unfortunately sphinx complains about indented lines in the `Returns` sections. I don't know if we should comply with it though...
  So the following is invalid according to sphinx:

```
Returns:
    tuple: some long text...
        continuing text....
```

and sphinx wants it to be:

```
Returns:
    tuple: some long text...
    continuing text....
```

To me it seems like a bug that needs reporting but may never be fixed ;)

Hmm, you can call them `executable` and `data_dict`.
In addition, maybe do everything in the `Perform analysis`, `Executable` and `Collect` sections in one loop?
Just remove the last 2 for loops, and fix the indentation of the comments.
```python
for executable, data_dict in executables.items():
    # Perform analysis
    ...

    # Executable
    ...

@DjLegolas 
I could be wrong in all of this however, some thoughts. I don't think you are supposed to run collect before you are done with analysis/executable. Maybe it will not matter in our case. Also maybe instead of data_dict since we have variables data and execute maybe executables_dict would be more on the nose. Also maybe script_name instead of executable since its not actually referring to a executable and rather the name of the script we are building for.

Edit: ok yes I think coll += can go in loop but not COLLECT. Maybe that just shows another point maybe instead of coll it could be exe_plus_data?"

Anyway, I looked little into it now, and don't have more time now, but found seemingly for some reason an older setuptools(47.1.0) is installed for python's under 3.10(tested 3.7, 3.9 and 3.10), and when upgrading setuptools afterwards to newest, then works. Probably need pin setuptools to 68.0.0, as latter two versions are py3.8 and up.

Also, in requirements.txt, then I believe twisted should be pinned to 22.10(or below), like in CI, as else: ""Nameerror fdesc is not defined"", when newest twisted installed.

Thanks! :)

Edit: Setuptools version variances because included already(as dep) with pip/python.

Edit2(last): In quick test here(not CI though), then pyinstaller 4.10 doesn't fail(py3.9.8), though have as always displayed a bunch missing typelib errors, originating from one of the hooks being buggy, though not important for us, as a misunderstanding those messages. Pyinstaller 5 broke freezing completely(hence 4.10 pin added), as respected those errors instead of just forward/log and ignore, but they gracefully fixed it for us in next version(maybe next again, can't remember, and I made PR to update pyinstaller and drop 4.10 pin, but I closed it later, and Cas thought not important to update at the time). Sorry if misunderstanding and 4.10 has actual error blocking on CI now and not just cosmetic, or that you already knew these things. Granted might as well update pyinstaller as well, and is confusing to end-users looking at, and just elaborating.

Just to note that the versions specified in requirements are usually there as a project minimum/maximum rather than for CI/CD and shouldn't be removed without checking the commit history. There are likely some improvements to how we handle the dependencies for project, packaging and CI/CD.

Also until we specifically drop support for Python 3.7 I still want the runners for it. The total number of Python versions to test against should also be small so we don't have to wait too long for them all to finish. There could be an improvement where we run a single Python version for the PR/tests and then run against all versions once merged to develop branch."

What requires the last version of libtorrent on git (and doesn't work with other versions) is the check on i2p_socket flag which can be eventually subsituted by a check on ip (i2p peers have 0.0.0.0:0 address) the ""pid"" i've introduced is even in older versions so it is not a problem. Anyway this code is just a matter of visualization everything works fine even without it but it's ""ugly"" to see an empty peer list :-)

What would be nice to add as a feature is the option to disable dht and pex (these are not yet available when using i2p in libtorrent) when selecting the i2p proxy and an option to enable mixed mode (this one is actually possible only with the ltconfig plugin)."

I can see the relevant changes but the code actually needs to handle when that attribute is missing for backwards compatibility.

For the same reason the UI client code needs to handle connecting to older daemons that do not have `pid` or `i2p` keys in the peer dict from get_peers.

We really should have tests associated with the core changes.

In the latest libtorrent version (2.0.9.0) there have been some changes in managing i2p:
1 - It's no more needed (but according to devs it has never) to set a proxy for i2p but it's enough to set i2p_hostname and i2p_port parameters.
2 - there's now a function to get the i2p address (destination): peer_info::i2p_destination() (which under my request has a python binding too) so using the pid can be now dropped.
3 - There are new option to fine-tune the i2p SAM connection: tunnels outbound and inbound lenght and quantity.

So I think that my pull request is now outdated.

Changing a file's type from symlink to text file tramples on the user's legitimate wishes and intentions, for no good reason and no benefit to anyone. The change I propose loses nobody anything and gains symlink users correct application behavior, would be my claim in support of it.

Also what happens if a user then requests that the state files or the entire config directory should be able to be symlinked, do we also make that change? How acceptable is it that the `.new` and `.bak` files will also be created in the symlinked location? Rarely are changes to a project trivial.

I am saying that overwriting a symlink which points to the config file is precisely *not* overwriting the config file, it's overwriting something else somewhere else. As to whether this PR is a bug or an RFE, I don't care what it's called so long as it gets in. I will simply observe that most programs exhibit the correct behavior. (deluge is definitely not the only one overwriting symlinks though.)

I also wondered about the `.new` and `.bak` files. As a first pass, I would suggest the right place for `.new` is `$TEMP` or `%TEMP%`, and for `.bak` it's the target config file's enclosing directory (no change for `.bak`, in other words)."

I'm not sure about pulling the system service for `default.target`; I don't know how that interoperates when booting into rescue mode or other special modes. It might be fine, but I can't guarantee it.

Ultimately though, shipping the two distinct files makes life easier for packagers of systemd-based distros since it signals that they can just copy both of them to their respective locations.

This was a long time ago, but I think the reason to make it a single file was the same as you have now splitting it up -- performance.  I think writing a lot of small files (especially with very large sessions) could cause some slow downs, but it could have just been the way it was done at the time.  I could see a slow disk causing some issues.  For what it's worth, my original implementation was single files and my intention was to allow updating individual fast resume data without having to write out a large file each time.  *shrug*

No; you can see in the [code](https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/blob/b1cdc32f7357e9777eb6cc2d90094c7d122af2eb/deluge/ui/web/web.py) that there's no `-d` option for `deluge-web` (which as you point out is a separate executable).

> I do find this very misleading, because in reality -L debug is the command line parameter that enables debug logging.
 
In the `deluged` executable, `-d` is for `--do-not-daemonize`. I think (but have not checked) this option may have once existed in `deluge-web` too, but either way, it needs to be removed from these service docs because when someone tries to build a systemd service that tells the system to run `deluge-web` with `-d`, it is going to fail:

$ deluge-web -d
