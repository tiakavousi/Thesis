The code I have as written does have the pluggable handler notion since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse it's interface) to the scanner.

424,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hmm.  Breaking #if($query.foo) compatibility isn't ok if we can't find a reasonable way to keep that and the sub then i'll ditch the sub.   But i much prefer $query.foo.bar over $query.get('foo.bar') so i'm not going to give that up quickly.  The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion then you may as well just put the source map into the context.  Anyway i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.  If i can't then expect me to resurrect the sub in a later version where complete backwards compatibility isn't necessary.,0

461,OrtuJIRA_test_0,I'm still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity.  I'll just point a few things out.  1/ I didn't veto anything and this has nothing to do with C++.  I think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added.  This in dangerous in the long term.  2/ I have no problem reverting this change.  3/ Restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea.,1

487,OrtuJIRA_test_0,If this is deemed to be a valid bug you can use my upcoming patch which simply doesn't pass the calls  to getLoginTimeout and setLoginTimeout through to the BasicDataSource.  I guess it could be a  good thing to let the BasicDataSource throw the UnsupportedOperationException notifying the  programmer that their call to the method really isn't doing anything.    OTOH they probably  care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way.   If they really want to know why their call to setLoginTimeout isn't working they can check the  included javadoc.  So if you decide it's a bug then there's a patch coming...,0
488,OrtuJIRA_test_0,"""Now the following tag:  <html:javascript dynamicJavascript=""""false"""" staticJavascript=""""true"""" />  Always adds  <script .....>  ... </script>.  I thought that staticJavascript purpose was to allow things like:  <script src=""""<html:rewrite page='/staticJs.jsp' />"""" type=""""text/javascript""""></script>  And create a jsp with something like:  <%@ page language=""""java"""" contentType=""""text/javascript"""" %> <%@ taglib uri=""""struts-html"""" prefix=""""html"""" %> <html:javascript dynamicJavascript=""""false"""" staticJavascript=""""true"""" />  And take profit of browsers cache.

502,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hi which version do I need to apply the patch on?,0
503,OrtuJIRA_test_0,First draft.  This just does the mapping in the constructor to the comparator.  We could do setNextReader but I can't imagine it will really make much difference given the small number of items that we typically would expect to be elevated.,0
504,OrtuJIRA_test_0,I created a class that extends UpdateRequestProcessor which logs calls to each method. In the console output you'll see that only the processAdd methods are called when using the DIH in debug mode and the user checks verbose and commit.  I've attached the SOLR configuration that can be used to replicate the issue. I'm assuming that once Lucene commits the files the UpdateRequestProcessor.processCommit method should be called too.   *UpdateRequestProcessorTest.class*  package org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport,0

509,OrtuJIRA_test_0,The DismaxRequestHandler and StandardRequestHandler are both deprecated and replaced with SearchHandler.,0
510,OrtuJIRA_test_0,bq. Actually DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH â I'm not sure what value it will bring.   I've got a sharded index,0
511,OrtuJIRA_test_0,"""{quote} ...but even if we don't do that i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms) I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).   So I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for """"named similarity"""" that have to do with term weighting I'm interested. """,0

525,OrtuJIRA_test_0,"""Of course I totally agree with Yonik.  I don't care that much what the default include is (upper lower ...) as long as it doesn't double-count. Double-counting is bad -- it can lead to a bad user experience. There's something about """"lower"""" that I feel makes it slightly better than """"upper"""" but I can't really explain the rationale. I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).  Just because its easy to set the include doesn't mean the default is arbitrary.  Any way if the default remains to double-count I'm going to insist that my readers for the second edition of my book change this value.""",0

533,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Mike: patch reads nice and clean to me (didn't try applying though)  two nits:   1) it would be good to have a test of the case where a boolean with the default boost is specified in one bq and a seperate blank bq is specified to force the first BQ to be treated as a single query  2) let's assign  params.getParams(DMP.BQ) to a temp variable so we don't have to call it twice in three lines.,0
534,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hi Guillaume  I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status is quite useful.  But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.  I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode otherwise it's better not  to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point that we've just implemeted.

596,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan,1

656,OrtuJIRA_test_1,[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,1

673,OrtuJIRA_test_1,bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this? Thanks,1

699,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length],1

729,OrtuJIRA_test_1,"""Hi Bilgin  you are right the entitymode.xml can be removed but I when I add it I'm thinking to add a new filed to PosTerminalInternTx  entity to store """"Pos Paid Reason"""" instead of store it in the reasonComment field.

733,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Sorry Jacques I have not seen that it was a grouped bugs.  In this case I have used to set in the grouped bugs the sum of the components used by detailed issues.  I didn't like unknow components.  Otherwise we can add a new fictitious component - GROUPED ISSUES - and assign this component to this type of issue.   Thanks  Marco,1
734,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes I have been watching OFBIZ-1453 with interest.  I approve of the issue and implementation and didn't have anything to add so I haven't been involved.  The thing I have been thinking about is that there's some assumptions to be made here for pricing and the type of question.  I.e. multiselect questions should display the absolute price.  I'm also trying to work over some other scenarios.  I'll clean up what I have an submit a patch tomorrow.,0
735,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Marco BTW I have only helped Santosh Malviya for OFBIZ-1468 where ever he needs and reviewed his work. After that Its only his effort to convert java to minilang + testing the patch. So majority of credit goes to Santosh Malviya :),1

If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable """"MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"""" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go.

I haven't looked in trunk yet.    The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.  Someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a 2.9.2 version using the snk whenever the next release does come out.,0
797,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi Bianco First of all could you add a apache licence to the file VectorHighlightMapper.cs?

All Lucene.Net community! Any idea about what  we should do?  DIGY,0
798,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Following the recent facets work I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):  * Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600) and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one but it looks like we can get rid of it too.,0
799,OrtuJIRA_test_1,"""I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089 though I just used a Map<StringString>.

I got unhappy here in the """"splitting"""" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the """"don't load"""" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an """"untyped"""" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

801,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Patch adds maybeRefreshBlocking which blocks on refreshLock.

804,OrtuJIRA_test_1,From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a âcloneâ¿ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy â we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/â¦ which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thatâs a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Itâs currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer thatâs better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap â both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole âmessageâ¿ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....,0

But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of """"purity"""".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay Mark me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect """"live"""" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think secondary ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. """,0

821,OrtuJIRA_test_1,There is a bug in PayloadNearQuery. If there are multiple top level spans that match the query only the payloads of the first one are retrieved. This patch fixes this bug by iterating over all the top level spans to get the payloads (see 'setFreqCurrentDoc')  > The base explain method can't be abstract. Something like Ah right. This is included in the patch  >The changes don't seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables. It may still be all right but have you looked at this aspect?

848,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Thanks for getting started on this. I have a couple of requests -  1. Could you please upload a patch to this JIRA and grant it to Apache ?  2. This patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would ?   It will make it much easier for us to review it.   Also when you said the zk connect option hangs did you get a chance to take a look at the debug/trace logs to see where it hangs ? Do you mind uploading those log files here ?,0
849,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi ShengTao you would think if you follow:  1. Check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. Then add a bindingTemplate.  Then you would not be overwriting a bindingTemplates. You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there. The current behavior is how the UDDI v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec.  Please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues.   --Kurt,0

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards,0

884,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Oleg  I agree it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike,0

BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from SNN and CN.

Please add javadoc for the new classes and new public methods on existing classes.  {{FavoredNodeAssignmentHelper#placeSecondaryAndTertiaryWithRestrictions}} introduces a {{while(true)}} block containing non-trivial branching logic. Can this be refactored with simpler and/or clearer break conditions?  {{FSUtils}} introduces new configuration {{hbase.client.localityCheck.threadPoolSize}}. Can this be added to {{HConstants}} and/or documented in {{hbase-defaults.xml}}?,0
941,OrtuJIRA_test_1,bq.It handles both meta is not assigned and it is double assigned. Yes,0
942,OrtuJIRA_test_1,The same appears to be try for case_studies.xml community.xml and zookeeper.xml. Should those not be copied for some other reason?,0
943,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Patch attached.,0
944,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes 70x indicates something amiss.,0
945,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes that's right.,0
946,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi Lars sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO the fix makes it easier to understand as well. In addition the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there.  I think it'd be better if the fix were in sooner but it's probably not an issue if we moved it to 0.94.7.,-1
947,OrtuJIRA_test_1,v4 Patch does not apply snapshot branch ff25969ea0b2ff38cc25512a02569c351e757d66  Looks like this is built upon some of the online snaphots work.  What branch/hash does this go on Matteo?,0
948,OrtuJIRA_test_1,From step 3 do you think the double-splitting is a new phenomenon?  It doesn't sound like something that should happen very often.  Maybe that would explain why i didn't get this error in .94.0.  Also please note I went straight from .94.0 to .94.2 so I don't know if it was present in .94.1.,0
949,OrtuJIRA_test_1,The patch here seems to be attached to a wrong jira. Sorry about the confusion. I have re-attached the path here.,-1
950,OrtuJIRA_test_1,hmm looks like I didn't save all java files after mass-replace of whitespace. I will attach another patch nothing of significance will change,0
951,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Thanks Elliot! Did you forget to add FailedSanityCheckException to the 0.94 patch? If the same as in 0.96 I'll just add it at commit.  Will the new exception cause compatibility issues in old 0.92.x and 0.94.{0|1} clients? I don't think so... Just making sure.,0
952,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Attaching a patch with the typo fixed. I'm going to try that along HBASE-6550 and HBASE-6165 now.,0
953,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Assigning to Sameeer since apparently he can't assign to himself.,0
954,OrtuJIRA_test_1,@Marcelo I was thinking these changes:  {code} -    public static AuthResult allow(String reason User user Permission.Action action byte[] table) { -      return new AuthResult(true reason user action table null null),0
955,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Looks like this broke imports into Intellij,0
956,OrtuJIRA_test_1,@Andy Thanks for pointing it out.  We did  not take the latest patch by mistake and thought this change was missing.  Sorry about that. But still i think this JIRA we can use to solve  {code} org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestImportExport.testSimpleCa,0
957,OrtuJIRA_test_1,What I'm committing... wraps a very long line else what Matteo suppied.,0
958,OrtuJIRA_test_1,@Lars I don't think it would be all that different. I'll take a crack next week (after dealing with the next round of HBASE-6055 stuff).,0

972,OrtuJIRA_test_1,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :),0

975,OrtuJIRA_test_1,So there is another thing here by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from CMS space thus radically increasing the GC complexity of the cache.  Originally when the LRU block cache came in it made my collections 10x as slow until I disabled the block cache for compactions.  Unfortunately all these micro-optimizations might be falling under the GC wayside.,0

977,OrtuJIRA_test_1,This patch removes tohtml.xsl and adds configuration_to_docbook_section.xsl.  The latter generates a docbook section from our hbase-default.xml using maven-xml-plugin that runs before the docbook plugin.  Our book then xincludes the generated file (the patch includes this modification too).

986,OrtuJIRA_test_1,hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.  TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.,0
987,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table.,0

999,OrtuJIRA_test_1,VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.,0

1053,OrtuJIRA_test_1,> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration.,0

1077,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.,-1

1108,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Committed the 2a patch with revision 1187204.,0
1109,OrtuJIRA_test_1,I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently.,-1
1110,OrtuJIRA_test_1,I think clearing private fields should work in all JVMs since that's what the call to f.setAccessible(true) is for.

The tests also fail on 1.4.2 (both Sun and IBM).,0

1133,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Sorry for the mess there I was just trying to port CFS and Hive metastore too... but those tests don't work right now so put it on hold getting it to work with CQL3 Column Families is a priority for me right now so will come back to those later.  Just for the Hive handler please look at the (cas-support-simple-hive) branch - https://github.com/milliondreams/hive/tree/cas-support-simple-hive  All the test cases (whatever few they had) pass there and it is working perfectly with Thrift/Compact storage Column Families.,-1

1178,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Release Candidate 1 of this patch.  This patch contains: + add IP Address to CrawlDatum Version 5 (as byte[4])  + a IpAddress Resolver (map runnable) tool to lookup the IP's multithreaded + add a property to define if the IpAddress Resolver should be started as a part of the crawlDb update tool to update the parseoutput folder (contains CrawlDatum Status Linked) of a segment before updating the crawlDb. + using cached IP during Generation  Please review this patch and give me any improvement suggestion I think this is a very important issue since it helps to do _real_ whole web crawls and not end up in a honey pot after some fetch iterations. Also if you like please vote for this issue. :-) Thanks.,1

1186,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each.  - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating """"formatValueList"""" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...   As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. """,1

1245,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard â I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst â wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST """"modal"""" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  """,1

1249,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""""ASCII"""") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you """"register"""" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""""Whitespace"""") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... """,1

1252,OrtuJIRA_test_2,bq. If you back-port this to 2.9 you can't use any of the java.util.concurrent.* Very good point! - didn't thought about back porting at all.   bq. I'm not sure you need a separate SearcherHolder class - can't you re-use IndexReader's decRef/incRef? I guess I did not see the simplicity the reader offers - blind due to  java.util.concurrent.* :)  bq. I think there are some thread safety issues..  this is weird - on my dev machine and in the patch it is not synchronized.. on the machine I run the tests it is. Anyway you are right.   I changed the code to be compatible with 2.9 using indexReaders.dec/incRef.. will attache in a minute,1

1270,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""1. My feeling is that """"if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"""" is not necessary since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call similar to getRecordIfStored it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3.

1296,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I haven't spent enough time thinking about this but I think it is more than just fixing the error message string. It seems that the comparable method in DTD should return int rather than boolean and the return int value will decide if we should throw what we are throwing today (ie something like ERROR 42818: Comparisons between 'VARCHAR' and 'CHAR' are not supported. ) or throw a new message because collations don't match. This is just my initial thought haven't spend enough time to think about a solution,0
1297,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so I'll file a bug for that.,0

1315,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Noah said heâs going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but Iâd like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didnât suggest it is a grunt.js error but itâs the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     â¦and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isnât a make error.,0
1316,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Dang just realized this might be hard.  Each individual node can't really predict when/where conflicts will happen. So how would it avoid compacting away the shared parent?,0
1317,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That's what reminded me of ubjson actually. I looked at UBF and it looks rather complicated for a data exchange. I wouldn't say no but I don't have any interest in supporting it.  ubjson shouldn't be anything more than writing a parser (which should be ~trivial) and then adding the logic to switch (de)serializers based on content and accept types. I have no idea what UBF really even is under the hood but it sounded a lot more complicated.,0

1329,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,0

1346,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they don't seem to be the cause of the issue. Something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places. We need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place. It might be very well be releated to the security provider. Can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory?,0

1355,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately.  1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand they don't seem bad but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again actually I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that.,0
1356,OrtuJIRA_test_2,in addition to that DataContext.newObject() shouldn't throw on classes that are not DataObjects.,0
1357,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I was actually trying to debug the issue and didn't see anything that looked like it would nuke the DataMap/DataNode under the DataDomain and was wondering if it was a visual issue but didn't try saving the model to see if it had actually deleted it.

1360,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean """"wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"""" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.""",0

1377,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Truth is that the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though.,0

1441,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Would anybody now if this is fixed in a later release?,0
1442,OrtuJIRA_test_2,hmm... i couldn't run your huge 7.5 MB application. Sorry for asking again but will it be possible to post a ***smaller*** test case? Actually that will also help you to isolate the issue.  - venkat,0
1443,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I added a patch to fix the deadlock issue.  I used the same type of approach as Brian Ewins did with his patch. So the addition of some of his concepts could be applied to fix them both at the same time.  Reference of his patch suggestion: http://nagoya.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-238?page=history,0
1444,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Attached a patch that adds a flag for opt-in and adds a test,0

1448,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Didn't make 1.1,0
1449,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Reopening this issue and Richard will add more information into the JIRA.,0
1450,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Hi Fuhwei  I was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch so I have taken a good long look at this but as its an area of the code I'm not very familiar with I can't necessarily jump in with an expert comment.  My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method      XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent xsdElementDeclaration),0
1451,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This is not a major issue,0
1452,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I don't see that he fixed anything for TS-2216 are you thinking of his commit for TS-1988 ? I was going to try that.,0
1453,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I mean keep purging that cache asset.,0
1454,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Committed @revision 1340076 in trunk,0
1455,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""The appassembler author has rejected a long outstanding bug in this area as """"Won't Fix"""" http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAPPASM-54   They seem to think that because the script is not internally broken that they shouldn't need to worry about it.  """,0
1456,OrtuJIRA_test_2,We found the root cause of the problem. Will add a patch,0
1457,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I added your tests and didn't see any failures against ActiveMQ.  However I did make a change anyway to StompFrame similar to you patch expect that I just used the DataInputStream's readFully method to ensure all the data gets pulled off the wire.,0
1458,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Resolved in trunk.  There were two places where the ack message was getting the Destination from the Message assigned to it instead of the Destination from the MessageDispatch command.,0
1459,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Nathan  I have not been able to get the time to run the other tests.  However I did try changing the timeoutwait.  I set it to 10000 as suggested.  The test failed as it did before.  I then decided to change it to an unrealistic number 60000.  The program died as it did before.  Whats interesting with this test is that it did not even run for a minute.  As such I dont think changing this value had any impact on the problem.,0
1460,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The DebugDLL and ReleaseDLL build configurations for vs2005-activemq didn't have the /DEBUG linker flag turned on.,0
1461,OrtuJIRA_test_2,From what i can see on the system the libpthread is in /usr/lib and in /usr/lib64 and both of those paths are in my library config.,0
1462,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ran the test with a 5.8-SNAPSHOT build an everything seems fine.,0
1463,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Fresh build works for me now too.  Looks like the missing snapshot has been published somewhere now.,0
1464,OrtuJIRA_test_2,receive()  and receive(timeout ) now return null on transport failure - so consistent behaviour with a close() on the connection.,0
1465,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Enabled garbage collection on transient and durable queue message managers.  Also added a check on capacity limit before removing idle containers.,0
1466,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Commited to trunk.,0
1467,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Can you run: {noformat} yum repolist all {noformat}  and post what you see?,0
1468,OrtuJIRA_test_2,User specified directory is not created by agent,0
1469,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Attached,0
1470,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I checked it on IE and firefox and it was working fine. Though i am not sure why it didnt work particularly in chrome i put those elements in a separate div and this helped. Now its working fine in Chrome also.,0
1471,OrtuJIRA_test_2,How do you know that a key will exceed a threshold until after you've passed it?,0
1472,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Fixed. Committed revision 745895.,0
1473,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I did try some variations as well and I have to say I only got confused.,0
1474,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Confused about this.,0
1475,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases.,-1
1476,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If they do then Suse's cpio works for old ascii but the -c switch is broken.,-1
1477,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This is pretty embarassing!,-1
1478,OrtuJIRA_test_2,When you install a node module globally it goes into /usr/local where you don't have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo.,-1
1479,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That being said I'm not totally opposed to making the limit configurable.,-1
1480,OrtuJIRA_test_2,My bad I screwed up the assertion -> RuntimeException transition.,-1
1481,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Well that sucks.,-1
1482,OrtuJIRA_test_2,No it's not off the table but it's moot unless we decide we want cqlsh in-tree at all.,-1
1483,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ok here is a patch that works. I was stupid enough not to see it...,-1
1484,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for QuorumOpMonitor.,-1
1485,OrtuJIRA_test_2,All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.,-1
1486,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Just to clarify... you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS...   Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?,-1
1487,OrtuJIRA_test_2,+1 (damn intellij it's not like patch format hasn't been standard for years),-1
1488,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Wow it's like Thrift is going out of their way to make life suck for us this month.,-1
1489,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Here is quite bad.,-1
1490,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The samples you gave are different.,-1
1491,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"I just noticed your public tweet...  bq. ""@wilhelmbierbaum True. Fuck the Avro C API.""",-1
1492,OrtuJIRA_test_2,if so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy?,-1
1493,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h() might no longer be used either e.g. ink_gettimeofday() is never used so lets get rid of that shit.,-1

1495,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What a stupid name I chose for that object... )-:,-1
1496,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think it's time to just close this issue.,-1

1498,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I am currently trying to get it into AJDT dev builds but my git push is timing out (damn thing!,-1
1499,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Stupid Maven,-1
1500,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ok. Stupid user Error here.,-1
1501,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Converted from a single FlatFileItemWriter to a database and flatfileitemwriter and didn't register the flatfile one as a stream.,0
1502,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If using a single FlatFileItemWriter it is enough to register it as an ItemWriter however when using the composite the adding it as a stream is also needed.,0
1503,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why the hell do they deliver Duration if they cannot instantiate it :-/,-1
1504,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The defect  from hell 666 be scared..,-1
1505,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This really sucks!,-1
1506,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why the hell is this not a bug?,-1
1507,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm confused...,0
1508,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What the hell are you waiting for ?,-1
1509,OrtuJIRA_test_2,you can't reopen stuff fixed in the past without upsetting JIRA.,0
1510,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I've fixed that locally and am doing a full build but I'm going to build a test case to duplicate the error and then verify my proposed fix corrects it.,0
1511,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or Infinispan connectors and is simply a (stupid) mistake in the federated join processor.,-1
1512,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm an idiot.,-1
1513,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The Cenqua licensing section doesn't have a license like this but the Clover licensing section does have a link to one.,0
1514,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies.,-1
1515,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.,-1
1516,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Crap forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI it's not.,-1
1517,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Please close as this is just me being stupid.,-1
1518,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Holy hell I think I found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else.,-1
1519,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This sucks *so much*...,-1
1520,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.,-1
1521,OrtuJIRA_test_2,*Damn* I forgot.,-1
1522,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.,-1
1523,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Damn it seemed it didn't work.,-1
1524,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay.,-1
1525,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I don't have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes *you* must do that.,-1
1526,OrtuJIRA_test_2,And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup.,-1
1527,OrtuJIRA_test_2,who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?,-1
1528,OrtuJIRA_test_2,fuck u,-1
1529,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise.,-1
1530,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.,-1
1531,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This sucks badly.,-1
1532,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why on earth does createLink() need a request?,-1
1533,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Finally closing this bug from hell.,-1
1534,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I sure as hell don't want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards.,-1
1535,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That sucks why isn't the escape mechanism working?,-1
1536,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I am an idiot - this was a dupe of GUVNOR-84,-1
1537,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That is really confusing.,0
1538,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Sun RI sucks why the hell is saveState() and restoreState() not called with with javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD = server???,-1
1539,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Swear to god I'm not a total idiot.,-1
1540,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I don't know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I've removed them now.,-1
1541,OrtuJIRA_test_2,durrrh that sucks.,-1
1542,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Im stuck with IE6 unfortunately.,-1
1543,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What the hell I'll give this a shot.,-1
1544,OrtuJIRA_test_2,{quote} searcher.getAtomicReader().getSortedDocValues(uniqueKey) {quote}  This is a performance killer.,-1
1545,OrtuJIRA_test_2,As far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could/should do Thread.currentThread().setName(x) or whatever (and maybe restore after),-1
1546,OrtuJIRA_test_2,BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).,-1
1547,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Hmm that sucks.,-1
1548,OrtuJIRA_test_2,tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!,-1
1549,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Oh man ... it's a fucking precendence problem.,-1
1550,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ugh well that sucks.,-1
1551,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I didn't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3.x to 4.x  :-(  That sucks and it'll make old code stick around longer.,-1
1552,OrtuJIRA_test_2,bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.,-1
1553,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That sounds like some serious buck passing.,-1
1554,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This whole thing is very distressing to me.,-1
1555,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think we all know it just sucks.,-1
1556,OrtuJIRA_test_2,though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you madeI don't think we would ever come to agreement anyway.,-1
1557,OrtuJIRA_test_2,that's some freaky shit ...,-1
1558,OrtuJIRA_test_2,i could have sworn i clicked the other radio button,0
1559,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think you made mistakes in ivy.xml.,-1
1560,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This is where it gets confusing.,-1
1561,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If I can give you one advice on this one I'd say this: fuck Derby use H2 instead as the default embedded database.,-1
1562,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Of course it is.,0
1563,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I am slightly confused by the above.,0
1564,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Anyway created a patch ...,0
1565,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ah HA!,0
1566,OrtuJIRA_test_2,or a log message?,0
1567,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Until there is a general mechanism Hbase should do something.,0
1568,OrtuJIRA_test_2,but there is no such limitation in the consistent algorithm behind ZK.,0
1569,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It will be taken care as part of HADOOP-7642.,0
1570,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The contribution archive.,0
1571,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What is convenient for the user to download two archives to run the project (or install maven)?,0
1572,OrtuJIRA_test_2,+1 for the docs in the SRC though.,0
1573,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Okay Edward you haven't understood how it works.,0
1574,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Maybe you know it better when I show you some code.,0
1575,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If you want to have a binary sequencefile format then do this.,0
1576,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What if you want to change this binary format?,0
1577,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Do you want to recreate every file on the whole planet?,0
1578,OrtuJIRA_test_2,You must take care about versioning then and that is because we need a proxy between the inputformat and our vertex API.,0
1579,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Contributed by Vinay.,0
1580,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Previously we are mainly focus on trunk failures.,0
1581,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Yea I think it would be worth distinguishing between the reasons.,0
1582,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Gimme a few mins to clean this up properly.,0
1583,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Is the -put command returning non-0 to indicate failure?,0
1584,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Is it by mistake?,0
1585,OrtuJIRA_test_2,We should be assigning atleast 50% of it's capacity.,0
1586,OrtuJIRA_test_2,pread I mentioned is FSInputStrea.read(long buf offset len).,0
1587,OrtuJIRA_test_2,multiple pread invocations hitting contiguous byte ranges is quite tricky.,0
1588,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I would have hopped that the URI(String) constructor would have decoded things properly (or encoded them as it happens to be here).,0
1589,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Continue with stupid questions :)  Who is sponsor and mentor of project?,0
1590,OrtuJIRA_test_2,So who should create mail lists bug databases etc.,0
1591,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Fixed bug of <hr /> the siteinfo is always after the rest of the page now.,0

1599,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Will close this as a dup.,0
1600,OrtuJIRA_test_2,[rvollmar 3/27/07] There are two bugs that are causing backwards compatibility issues and I think the emails we've been exchanging have confused them.,0
1601,OrtuJIRA_test_2,First an attempt is made to convert       * each argument.,0
1602,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It is better to express such things in Java or in a query language that is designed for that.,0
1603,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why would I want to use XML when i can use the QBC API or HQL (HQL can be embedded in the XML remember) to express this stuff much more naturally?,0
1604,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"In addition in the longterm we will all most likely be using annotations and the ""fetch group"" notion does *not* work with annotations.",0
1605,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It's generally pretty straightforward but extensibility is not quite clear.,0
1606,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I have changed one test to see what will happend if I set the pwdIdle to b > 0 and the test passes.,0
1607,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What exactly is your configuration ?,0
1608,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The more I think about the issue the more I find it critical.,0
1609,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If we remove an entry while someone is doing a search the search will fail.,0
1610,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Also we have some problem during replication just when we try to replicate some deletion and it might prefectly explain why we get those issues.,0
1611,OrtuJIRA_test_2,(Ok as expected ...)  Waiting for a better log when you will have installed a new server build from 1.0-trunks then.,0
1612,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What you can do is trying this request with a different browser when the server is suppose to hang and also try to do another request when the serveur is supposed to be hang to see if it's not a pb with the PDU length ( what I suspect is that when trying to decode this request the decoder is waiting for more bytes so wait ad vitam aeternam ...) I gonna try to implement the decoding of this PDU as a test case just to check.,0
1613,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value which contains escaped values.,0
1614,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Here we have two options : 1) work with the internal value but escape all the special chars 2) work with the stored UP value.,0
1615,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think the bnest solution is (2) because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.,0
1616,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This will impact two parts : - searchResultEntry - all the response that contains a LdapResult and which returns a MatchedDN.,0
1617,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I already have a fix for the first request but the question is : which version will integrate this modification ?,0
1618,OrtuJIRA_test_2,any suggestion ?,0
1619,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I just applied the patch ran tests.,0
1620,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Then you might switch filter chains to ?,0
1621,OrtuJIRA_test_2,However I don't see any failures.,0
1622,OrtuJIRA_test_2,We need a proper JUnit test for this!,0
1623,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Thanks for reviewing the patch Mamta!,0
1624,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I've been trying to test a patched build with ibm 1.5. on iseries but have run into trouble: - OOM with suites.All.,0
1625,OrtuJIRA_test_2,A second run (with 2048M) only got worse (sooner) OOM behavior and after that I had trouble getting rid of my processes - apparent hang with derbyall:lang/wisconsin.java.,0
1626,OrtuJIRA_test_2,On rerun I let it go for 20 mins but apart from the database getting booted (derby.log) nothing at all showed up in any of the output files (i.e.,0
1627,OrtuJIRA_test_2,.tmp was empty).,0
1628,OrtuJIRA_test_2,During the 10.5.1.1 test cycle this test took about 5 mins (and passed).,0
1629,OrtuJIRA_test_2,So the original problem appears addressed (as I said the 3 failing tests now pass) but I will investigate these behaviors and run on another type of machine just to be safe.,0
1630,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think I prefer this approach.,0
1631,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I remember that rule for line breaking in Japanese was very different from that of English.,0
1632,OrtuJIRA_test_2,In English sentence there exists space between words and that space tells where the line can be breaked.,0
1633,OrtuJIRA_test_2,However Japanese sentence does not have such a useful space between words.,0
1634,OrtuJIRA_test_2,As I knows only punctuation tells where the line can *not* be breaked.,0
1635,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This may be well known problem in i18n in typography ....,0
1636,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Can this be closed?,0
1637,OrtuJIRA_test_2,derbynetmats had no failures.,0
1638,OrtuJIRA_test_2,You can close this out.,0
1639,OrtuJIRA_test_2,plz fix it properly till tomorrow Ort I'll close this for 0.4 again.,0
1640,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What was the outcome of the discussion?,0
1641,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Afair we settled on not implementing this as logging is hell anyway and we do not like to introduce just another logging framework.,0
1642,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Also we would need to handle Serialisation which is _only_ implementable in a performant way if you know the underlying logging framework.,0
1643,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'll open one now so I don't forget.,0
1644,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Think you could make a failing test case and/or patch to show the behaviour?,0
1645,OrtuJIRA_test_2,But I could join them.,0
1646,OrtuJIRA_test_2,For VMware we noticed that there are several places requiring cleanup of staging storage object which requires a generic approach to thoroughly fix them and cannot make it in 4.2.0.,0
1647,OrtuJIRA_test_2,OK this solution sucks and since people are relying on these scripts instead of using tools like ant we need to give them the ability to upgrade these tools without having to create a new project.,0
1648,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Any ideas?,0
1649,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why is it unsafe to share filter in SelectStatement for NQF?,0
1650,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Looks like you need to report this to the high-scale-lib project.,0
1651,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I thought that there are some common cases like tail and head caching or exclusion of columns that could be implemented.,0
1652,OrtuJIRA_test_2,But never mind - maybe the proposed cache is all greatness.,0
1653,OrtuJIRA_test_2,So to prevent a rude awakening for some users it might be cool to provide some means (config or whatever) that works similar as the current version.,0
1654,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Or at least schedule this for a release which allows for a downgrade.,0
1655,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Gotta show off the shinies first of course.,0
1656,OrtuJIRA_test_2,So we convert Scanner back into an Iterator over a lazily fetched Slice subclass?,0

1660,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm very very keen on preserving backwards compatibility.,0
1661,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The Calculator sample now works with SimpleAxisServer.,0
1662,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Is there any documentation how to use axis2-wsdl2code-maven-plugin with jibx binding and how on hell you define  xmlns:tns from you binding file,0
1663,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Do you think you can make us a minimal test case which demonstrates the problem?,0
1664,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Please close AXIS-2271 if that patch is taken.,0
1665,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This practice in general seems really confusing to me this bug is refed in the 1.5.0 release notes tagged in svn.,0
1666,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think all properties and permissions should be maintained.,0
1667,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Well I'm not sure what was happening but I just upgraded to Spring 1.2 final and this issue does not happen anymore.,0
1668,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It really *did* happen in an earlier version though....,0
1669,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I disagree.,0
1670,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The manual should provide sufficient insight into the important use cases.,0
1671,OrtuJIRA_test_2,People tend to review javadoc when things don't go as expected or are unclear.,0
1672,OrtuJIRA_test_2,In my case I wrote a custom filter fucked around with the configuration getting it to work which means you really have to get into it.,0
1673,OrtuJIRA_test_2,etc.,0
1674,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I reviewed javadoc but right or wrong I didn't come across this.,0
1675,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Google was also strangely quiet.,0
1676,OrtuJIRA_test_2,stupid autoresize option doesn't resize it correctly,0
1677,OrtuJIRA_test_2,) - it should be in AJDT in a couple of days.,0
1678,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I am sufficiently archaic as to have only a pre-ANSI-C K&R.,0
1679,OrtuJIRA_test_2,You can put *expressions* separated by commas in a for even back then:    for (i=1 j=100 i<j i++ j--)  But I guess that the tweak to allow *declarations* there only has one.,0
1680,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I was surprised to see this issue still getting so much commentary.,0
1681,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"I'm going to jump back to Robert's initial pushback here:  ""1.",0
1682,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I understand job execution creation needs to be atomic but I don't think it implies the whole logic around creating job execution must be handled by repository.,0
1683,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Using technical tricks like automatically appending parameters to create unique JobInstance makes alarm bell ring - we should not be trying to do clever arbitrary things in classes that form the foundation of the framework.,0
1684,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If job instance has a lifecycle that ends with first successful execution we should refuse to start the same job instance ever after.,0
1685,OrtuJIRA_test_2,We described before that there are times that operators for whatever reason what's to restart a job with the same instance.,0
1686,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It could be something as stupid as accidentally deleting the output file.,0
1687,OrtuJIRA_test_2,So it's like getting a new copy.,0
1688,OrtuJIRA_test_2,My bad.,0
1689,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Same goes for fontSize and fontWeight and other font styles.,0
1690,OrtuJIRA_test_2,But on the other hand I also think if the processor has to do this initialization activity (i.e.,0
1691,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Yeah it helps though I was more questioning whether there's not already a boolean that keeps track of this but apparently not.,0
1692,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Seems a bit restrictive to me that using rich:comboBox with s:convertEntity only displays entity IDs in the combo.,0
1693,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""rich:comboBox is not a select component by nature"" - so what is it then if it's not used for selecting stuff?",0
1694,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Guys this defect is 5 years old now.,0
1695,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If it's a regression please open a new ticket.,0
1696,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Yeah I didn't mean to imply that setting a null value was the problem which is why I changed my comment to denote the problem was actually in the federated connector.,0
1697,OrtuJIRA_test_2,It appears to be a simple cast to the wrong type (from a copy/paste error during coding).,0
1698,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'll copy that into a LICENSE.txt file.,0
1699,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The instructions are fine.,0
1700,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Not sure how I got that all wrong.,0
1701,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Note to self: Always check for platform-dependent behavior!,0
1702,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I've tested with Ruby 1.8 Ruby 1.9 JRuby and even Rubinius but all on Linux.,0
1703,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This lack of proper documentation on the standard Ruby API drives me mad.,0
1704,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Should this be raised to Ruby core folks to get the clarification?,0
1705,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Someone either needs to write a custom XSD and link it to the document or we need to disable validation for those examples pending another solution.,0
1706,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This request is unclear.,0
1707,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why are you asking us for samples?,0
1708,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm reopening the issue and Graeme will attach a new key which should be an OpenSSH SSH2-DSA key hopefully.,0
1709,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Nobody is able to tell what will happen here if something does not work.,0
1710,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Additionally... GroovyShell doesn't care about threading.,0
1711,OrtuJIRA_test_2,And even if it would be who makes sure that the context loader at the time the shell was created is the same as the context loader at the time the shell is used?,0
1712,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Can we even be sure that the thread is the same?,0
1713,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Logic like that has nothing to do with GroovyShell in my eyes.,0
1714,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If a threaded management is needed then a new class should be used that ensures the conditions are fulfilled.... that is at last that the context loader is unchanged.,0
1715,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I know in your webapp this condition might be fulfilled but GroovyShell is not special to web applications.,0
1716,OrtuJIRA_test_2,GroovyClassLoader does not know Groovy classes the parent *must* know them.,0
1717,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Because of that the default parent is the same loader as the loader that loaded the class GroovyShell - this loader knows the groovy classes.,0
1718,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Setting the context class loader would require a test if the context loader knows Groovy classes and if this class is the same as the expected loader... what do we do if that is not the case?,0
1719,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Throw an exception?,0
1720,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I don't want to put too much magic in the classloader structure because it becomes messy as hell in an instant.,0
1721,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Maybe first see the results of the discussion at: http://www.nabble.com/Undocumenten-constraints---consistency-of-templates-td21863067.html,0
1722,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'll make that change and close the issue.,0
1723,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Woo hoo!,0
1724,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Why attach the page?,0
1725,OrtuJIRA_test_2,In other words using the setGenerateImportedSchemas() setter or not obviously makes a difference and given the fact that your main XML schema imports/includes the other one I'd suggest that you change your code generation strategy.,0
1726,OrtuJIRA_test_2,That's basically all I am saying.,0
1727,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I know this is a closed issue but here goes anyway.,0
1728,OrtuJIRA_test_2,First there are some backwards compatibility concerns.,0
1729,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Clearly you don't understand the goals of Velocity or this is one hell of a humor piece.,0
1730,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Is this according to the spec?,0
1731,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Do I miss something there?,0
1732,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Of course in the end I'm not the one you need to convince as I'm not a maintainer :),0
1733,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The ci server does not close issue only comments on them I closed this issue.,0
1734,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This is a really cool idea but I don't think this is going to make it into TRUNK before the 0.4 branch gets cut.,0
1735,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Duplicated here TAP5-1017,0
1736,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Fixed in nightly build 20020623.,0
1737,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The reason the tests weren't failing is because i was an idiot and hadn't configured the queryResultCache properly in the test configs.,0
1738,OrtuJIRA_test_2,now that i've made the tests fail i can finally start trying to figure out why the tests fail.,0
1739,OrtuJIRA_test_2,SOLR-5232: SolrCloud should distribute updates via streaming rather than buffering.,0
1740,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Maybe instead of overlays try configuring maven-war-plugin {{<packagingExcludes>}}: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/skinny-wars.html,0
1741,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I wonder if we could do some sort of auto-detect  I'll poke -- getStream().mark()/reset() can probably work for XML/JSON but it may break things for javabin,0
1742,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Erick   First of all anyone upgrading should examine CHANGES.txt which would certainly have a note on this explicitly in the upgrading section of that document.,0
1743,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Secondly most point-release upgrades people do are ones in which the config stays the same.,0
1744,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Thirdly the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their 3.5 schema would only error if that person ALSO chose to omit the defaultSearchField declaration -- but why would they do that?,0
1745,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"Besides I don't think there should be any expectation of ""it'll just work"" if you copy some arbitrary subset of an old schema into a new example config.",0
1746,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If that's true it'd be nice if we had a standard way to annotate such code so we can methodically remove the old stuff.,0
1747,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""@deprecated"" isn't enough because it's just at the method/class level not an internal if branch.",0
1748,OrtuJIRA_test_2,{quote} you lost me there ... they can use the exact same configs ??? that's kind of the point: testing the exact example configs as we ship them (with <lib/> declarations that point at dirs which may or may not contain jars depending on what contribs are built and request handler / response writer declarations configured that use lazyloading to dynamic load things as needed.,0
1749,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Ah - i jumped the gun on you.,0
1750,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This has been the history of Lucene and the thing about the project that I admired most - heavy hands where checked at the door.,0
1751,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I'm no angel and I'm not perfect about this myself.,0
1752,OrtuJIRA_test_2,But I still try and police it because I think its important.,0
1753,OrtuJIRA_test_2,My personal beef in this issue is not with that though - I simply am very offended by heavy handed reverts and such.,0
1754,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I feel the same way about JIRA.,0
1755,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Words before action in my book - many words - hard as that can be for all of us sometimes.,0
1756,OrtuJIRA_test_2,explanation on SM-623,0
1757,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Should this issue be closed?,0
1758,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Didn't we just do this a month ago?,0
1759,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Thus the case is closed as non-reproducible.,0
1760,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The included things (usually chars or tokens) in the span are represented here as an interval and the end point is excluded.,0
1761,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Excluding_the_endpoints,0
1762,OrtuJIRA_test_2,If the dictionary were created with the flag to true then all entries would use a case sensitive comparison.,0
1763,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This JIRA will be closed.,0
1764,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think this is the third one you created in the same day?,0

1784,OrtuJIRA_test_3,[~shreepadma] thank you for working on it.   Do you have plan when you submit a patch? I know it takes efforts to code and test in 4 different types of databases.

1818,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Hi   Iâm trying to use hive performance benchmark. I read README file and followed step by step and finally I reached to the  data generation part. Teragen has no problem but I face a problem with htmlgen.  I configured something to my own cluster (40 VMs) and launched generateData.py  but it never finished! I launched it about 10 hours ago..  So I modified UserVisits and Rankings in config.txt to be smaller but it was also failed. Even it consumed very little resources when I saw 'top' information in the ubuntu.  Have you guys ever met this kinds of problems?  And if you have how did you solve this problem?  Thank you so much,1

1831,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The patch looks good to me. Some minors:  1. javadoc for two getINode() in SnapshotDiffList.java  2. We have DirectoryDiff ChildrenDiff Diff SnapshotDiff this is a little bit hard to follow. How about some renaming like SnapshotDiffForDirectory SnapshotDiffForFile?  3. SnapshotDiff#combinePosterior(final D posterior final BlocksMapUpdateInfo collectedBlocks)    can be renamed to deletePosterior or combineAndDeletePosterior so as to distinguish with Diff#combinePosterior?,1

1851,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.,1

1869,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Hi Ted Matteo  Thanks for the review.  The commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to 'rescue' some exceptions. It will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more ... The approach to expand (instead of shrink) this logic is not a bad or ugly one ...  But your suggested solution is fine.,1
1870,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Looks like the 0.95 issues are timeout related...should be good to go.,1
1871,OrtuJIRA_test_3,+1 for 0.95. Thanks.,1

2102,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Of course that would be a separate bug...,0
2103,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Of course I meant 2.1.8 beta not 2.1.8 dev.,0
2104,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This seems backward to me (but of course I'm no expert in this area).,0
2105,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Specially the framework.,0
2106,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This may fit for Pregel but not for our Framework since our communication is much more expensive.,0
2107,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Patch is pretty trivial but gives +15% on MT/SerialBench on 2-core Core2.,0
2108,OrtuJIRA_test_3,OK works for me.,0
2109,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Please re-open if I'm confused.,0
2110,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I must admit I'm a little confused by this one.,0
2111,OrtuJIRA_test_3,You mixing fd and HostComparator confused me.,0
2112,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Otherwise the HTable and the HConnection will get very confused.,0
2113,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Of course there is no NotNullException.,0
2114,OrtuJIRA_test_3,of course it could be built on the fly...,0
2115,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Of course this only applies if someone where to finish 831 and it where accepted...,0
2116,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Of course if you're writing your own serializer it's your responsiblity to deal  with this appropriately.,0
2117,OrtuJIRA_test_3,After a while that .api package will get pretty crowded too.,0
2118,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I will post a new patch pretty soon.,0
2119,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Framework translations in rev 701679.,0
2120,OrtuJIRA_test_3,How about a slightly different take?,0
2121,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Damn copy/paste programming.,0
2122,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Pretty impressive.,0
2123,OrtuJIRA_test_3,If so that's a pretty bad admin experience.,0
2124,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It seems pretty reliable.,0
2125,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I think the ability to hotswap a valve or even an entire pipeline real-time is pretty damn kewl!,0
2126,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Well your static analysis seems pretty persuasive to me.,0
2127,OrtuJIRA_test_3,What mocking framework should be used for the webui?,0
2128,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The framework is incomplete without it.,0
2129,OrtuJIRA_test_3,In revision 1064741 the framework is functional and activated for the enhancer.,0
2130,OrtuJIRA_test_3,At least it was intuitive for me and I am pretty new to all this.,0
2131,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Is there a way to stop the hbase with the regionserver dead?,0
2132,OrtuJIRA_test_3,If I am not wrong the follower that is stuck never accepts the leadership of the Leader in the ensemble because it is an established ensemble and it sees no quorum in it.,0
2133,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The 0.95 branch is dead and defunct.,0
2134,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'm assuming it's bytes since the variables are named 'buf' as opposed to the 'str' names used in the protocol APIs but want to double-check.,0
2135,OrtuJIRA_test_3,But I didn't get any memory errors.,0
2136,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It was confusing for me too.,0
2137,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Hmmm... confusing.,0
2138,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Doing things based on an organizationPartyId associated with the user is BAD BAD BAD and basically kills the multi-organization support in OFBiz.,0
2139,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I deleted the original attached files because they contain company informations that I'm not allowed to disclose.,0
2140,OrtuJIRA_test_3,So I'm totally +1 for the HBASE-8723 patch.,0
2141,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The verification of state over in timeout monitor before acting is another aspect?,0
2142,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The number of failed tests is pretty high compared to last time's performance (67 bad vs 3 last time).,0
2143,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Too late I'm away to bed and have lost concentration.,0
2144,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Converting to a double[ ] is where the precision is lost.,0
2145,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"And PayloadTermQuery lost an ""if (includeSpanScore)""?",0
2146,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'll have to bisect the revision since when it is broken and this could take some time.,0
2147,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The CDE is using the base UIMA framework to get the metadata.,0
2148,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However I'd be interested if later this functionality can also be used by ServiceMix i.e.,0
2149,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It's named .gitignore which may be confusing.,0
2150,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The original replica of RUR may in finalized state.,0
2151,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I just noticed that!),0
2152,OrtuJIRA_test_3,volatile prevents the variables from being cached in the registers and creates a memory barrier so that's not that surprising to see an impact on the performances.,0
2153,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The Felix framework does not support exporting/importing the default package.,0
2154,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Yep my bad too - I didn't look and was just guessing at what the problem was.,0
2155,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"- the computedHashCode() didn't use the a single ""qualifier"" now it does.",0
2156,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"Even during the full-blown ""validation"" of the descriptors (done just before ""saving"") the CDE is invoking the base UIMA framework in  special mode to prevent instantiation.",0
2157,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Move startTime from DecommingStatus to DatanodeDescriptor so startTime could be used to represent either decommissioning or dead start time 2.,0
2158,OrtuJIRA_test_3,once this error occurs the route cannot be used any more.,0
2159,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However controller passing live brokers minus shutting down brokers as live leaders in the LeaderAndIsrRequest sounds like a premature optimization and a bug.,0
2160,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The memory stream transformation core-dump was the same case (rb_tree - erase).,0
2161,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However the statement still performs a full scan of SUMMA_RECORDS which sounds sub-optimal.,0
2162,OrtuJIRA_test_3,> Actually I just noticed something when trying to commit.,0
2163,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Wicket 6 now features an experimental module that integrates the Atmosphere framework (wicket-atmosphere).,0
2164,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Then the algorithm gets lost as it did not expect this discontinuity.,0
2165,OrtuJIRA_test_3,A single table could be made up of many thousands even hundreds of thousands of regions?,0
2166,OrtuJIRA_test_3,bq.In order to maintain different states at which we are in while creating table should we go for a special node under the table znode or can we add new states to the existing table states like (DISABLING ENABLING DISABLED etc) IMO go with separate node.,0
2167,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Some further bug tracing shows that pdfbox' RandomAccessBuffer is responsible for the Out of Memory error.,0
2168,OrtuJIRA_test_3,#2 wontbe so bad... filters are pretty deep and will be just as efficient as hacking scan query Matcher I think.,0
2169,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Maybe you want to do shuffle in this way: Firstly copying remote map outputs and store the shuffled segments into memory as usual.,0
2170,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The outer read can continue for a much longer period of time.,0
2171,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The fix is only disabled on releases prior to 10.8.2 on the assumption that the fix gets into the upcoming 10.8.2 release.,0
2172,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Note that I wouldn't be totally opposed on adding additional support for the dot notation on inserts (provided all fields are indeed given) for symmetry/convenience.,0
2173,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I don't know that there's an alternative that would be less invasive than reverse logical time.,0
2174,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I don't quite see why the attached implementation would do more heap operations but I agree that it could be slower due to lengthier/more complex loops a few more if statements etc.,0
2175,OrtuJIRA_test_3,So what this patch does is totally revamps the makefiles for erlang.,0
2176,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"If I get to this first I will make the ""frameworks"" fix as well.",0

2179,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The times will be grep'ed and used for inspection in Excel.,0
2180,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Unfortunately the xml parser in use is event based in the wrong direction(push instead of pull) so the bulk of the change is flipping that around.,0
2181,OrtuJIRA_test_3,2) The ZKVersion used in the <topicregion> map is used to guard against the case different hub-server use the map at the same time (or interleaved).,0
2182,OrtuJIRA_test_3,html/ext/HtmlInputHiddenTag.java is pretty simple all of the functionality is in its base class.,0
2183,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Do you have a different desired text change or is it dead?,0
2184,OrtuJIRA_test_3,gcc 4.3.1 is out since June 2008 so the workaround is no longer needed.,0
2185,OrtuJIRA_test_3,The KahaDBStore.getDestinations() method looks as though it would be pretty heavy performance wise.,0
2186,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Tag is documented and demo'd but does need a Facelets tag.,0
2187,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I would rather state that most Java libraries *do* care about Maven.,0
2188,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Shouldn't it have looked at fstime across the directories seen dir2's higher fstime and used that one?,0
2189,OrtuJIRA_test_3,> The modified test (below) gets stuck in an infinite loop  Your test is buggy.,0
2190,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I have tried using Snappy{Input/Output}Stream and they don't work (it just throws EOFException in the middle of the transfer) and causes stream to retry.,0
2191,OrtuJIRA_test_3,this is IMO a regression since i am pretty sure it used to throw an InvalidItemStateException in the past.,0
2192,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'll take a look at where the framework should call it.,0
2193,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"Similarly one can use the overview of FD:OCA below and the introductory section of its respective volume and only ** refer to the details of the FD:OCA constructs as needed during implementation.""",0
2194,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Didn't see the selector the first time round.,0
2195,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This is pretty interesting.,0
2196,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Doh!,0
2197,OrtuJIRA_test_3,We do not use a framework.,0
2198,OrtuJIRA_test_3,doh fixed braces,0
2199,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I will appreciate if anyone knows of a way of doing that in junit framework.,0
2200,OrtuJIRA_test_3,If you are stuck with solr 4.0 alpha here's a patch which may work.,0
2201,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This patch also adds the new resource emulation framework to GridMix.,0
2202,OrtuJIRA_test_3,We need verify all the links and buttons in console to ensure the fix.,0
2203,OrtuJIRA_test_3,avro-mapred -- we might end up with avro-mapreduce as well for the newer api so I stuck with the package name of the hadoop api.,0
2204,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Sounds reasonable.,0
2205,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This sounds reasonable to me.,0
2206,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Content-wise the only part that stuck out to me was the inclusion of the many exceptions that users  will never see.,0
2207,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It's unfortunate that there's a lot of code duplication but it might be best that way.,0
2208,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Sounds reasonable to me given it's a standalone (debug) utility.,0
2209,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It is a little weird since the multi-core aspect would only be usable programatically but that will make it possible to easily bat around a 'core manager' and http design.,0
2210,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Can't be avoided though given what is going on here.,0
2211,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Pretty much the same stack trace.,0
2212,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I don't want to pull the whole patch though.,0
2213,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"However the NPE in the framework is still an issue even if it happens when there is a ""user error"".",0

2215,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Back-compat Lucene-style and agile design aren't something that marries well.,0
2216,OrtuJIRA_test_3,We are currently stuck with this issue?,0
2217,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Specifically the existing framework only lets us plug-in custom compress/decompress 'streams' (e.g.,0
2218,OrtuJIRA_test_3,If you really don't want such a link you could always hide it with CSS.,0
2219,OrtuJIRA_test_3,DROP INDEX <INDEX_NAME>  making this the only option right now would suck because we don't auto-generate an index name when none is provided.,0
2220,OrtuJIRA_test_3,There are just too many checks there that Click is not using and we can't just use them all (many don't make sense to Click at all) :).,0
2221,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'm not against fixing the CS I just want to ensure we do the 'right' fix.,0
2222,OrtuJIRA_test_3,That's why I'm going to use easymock as SMSC simulator.,0
2223,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Downgrading this as it is probably user error (rather than an explicit bug in the framework).,0
2224,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This was fixed Cassandra-side for 2.0 in CASSANDRA-5702 but the fix was pretty heavyweight and backporting to 1.2.x is not an option.,0
2225,OrtuJIRA_test_3,#1?,0
2226,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Nothing stops a slightly evil user to use a NoLock to wreak havoc in the index.,0
2227,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I pretty much have this working.,0
2228,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Please use git diff to generate patch because I can't easily apply git patch on a svn tree.,0
2229,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Does that sound like a reasonable plan going forward?,0
2230,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I won't intrude on the design discussion sounds good.,0
2231,OrtuJIRA_test_3,It can't have been this way always?,0
2232,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Fixed using the new injection framework and xwork configuration design.,0
2233,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Patrick  I can't manage to reproduce this error.,0
2234,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Otherwise we would be storing the bytes-per-checksum field but not actually using it which would be really confusing.,0
2235,OrtuJIRA_test_3,if it gets started at all.,0
2236,OrtuJIRA_test_3,[~jbellis] The weird thing is that although *newSSTables.size() != newSSTablesSize* the assertion doesn't actually cause an error so no stack trace but swapping the assertion (as shown below) yields the stack trace below.,0
2237,OrtuJIRA_test_3,J-D gave my patch a review and said fine except for some line-lengths which I've fixed.,0
2238,OrtuJIRA_test_3,To be quite blunt guys your log4net logger methods smell bad.,0
2239,OrtuJIRA_test_3,We've been passing builds pretty regular now so if this a problem it should start showing prominently.,0
2240,OrtuJIRA_test_3,You just need to remember to put the expected first in the assertion or it gets confusing,0
2241,OrtuJIRA_test_3,That can't be expressed with a static suffix but it's easily expressed with a regex.,0
2242,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'm not sure this can't be achieved without messing with IR/W guts so much.,0
2243,OrtuJIRA_test_3,2.8.0 is no longer supported so even if there is a bug it won't be fixed in 2.x.y release series.,0
2244,OrtuJIRA_test_3,In TestCliDriver create_view.q and udaf_percentile_approx.q are two weird queries.,0
2245,OrtuJIRA_test_3,By passing in the section name {{null}} the content of the global section can be retrieved.,0
2246,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I would have checked it in directly but there were some aspects  that I didn't care for but couldn't seem to get around.,0
2247,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Submit a patch and I'll play with it.,0
2248,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Please play around with it.,0
2249,OrtuJIRA_test_3,But I'd have to play with it some to see for certain.,0
2250,OrtuJIRA_test_3,"This is to say that we've a pretty good coverage of IDC ""keyref"" use cases.",0

2253,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I just realized I never really explained the original problem that led me to making these fixes.,0
2254,OrtuJIRA_test_3,So this is by design.,0
2255,OrtuJIRA_test_3,We can borrow some design techniques etc.,0
2256,OrtuJIRA_test_3,+1 For this new design.,0
2257,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I don't know what Lucene's position is on Maven but am interested pursuing whatever makes sense.,0
2258,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Marcus that sounds sensible.,0
2259,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I think MINA is more of a 'server framework' rather than an 'NIO framework'.. it is so close to being both.,0

2264,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Will pull that into the 2.0.4-alpha branch.,0
2265,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Maybe something silly is going one.,0
2266,OrtuJIRA_test_3,For the first part I got stuck on two points.,0
2267,OrtuJIRA_test_3,You really shouldn't call one without the other.,0
2268,OrtuJIRA_test_3,filtering hooked up through Solr already and it would be dead simple to bring in here too but it would fit nicely in this framework.,0

2276,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Jerermy is the sole subscriber/moderator and can take care of adding other subs.,0
2277,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Pretty much every deserialization error shows up as an IOException.,0
2278,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Are you planning on doing this (or already have done this) or would you like me to do it?,0
2279,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Doug you defined: +public interface NamenodeProtocols +  extends ClientProtocol +          DatanodeProtocol +          NamenodeProtocol +          RefreshAuthorizationPolicyProtocol +          RefreshUserToGroupMappingsProtocol { ...}  Will this prevent us from putting the DatanodeProtocol in a different port?,0
2280,OrtuJIRA_test_3,But would there be other cases that the writer stuck for different reasons?,0
2281,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However given the factored out code is pretty trivial I decided to duplicate it in favour of not adding another set of classes along with the additional complexity introduced (e.g.,0
2282,OrtuJIRA_test_3,There is a single directory ~apbackup/remotelybackedup and anything symlinked to there gets backed up as documented in the README.,0

2286,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Will commit in a few days (to the heavy committing branch) if no one objects.,0
2287,OrtuJIRA_test_3,This patch takes care of the nocommits in the previous patch.,0
2288,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I'll take care of this.,0
2289,OrtuJIRA_test_3,is anybody taking care of this?,0
2290,OrtuJIRA_test_3,There's a TODO which I'll take care of before merging to 4x (there are other renames too).,0
2291,OrtuJIRA_test_3,That would take care of most cases.,0
2292,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Yet now one must care for the relative ordering in between both icons too.,0
2293,OrtuJIRA_test_3,And it also will add a lot of complexity to the framework development/maintenance.,0
2294,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Adding a different patch.,0
2295,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However if the implementation of next is not capable of handling bad records then it is most likely going to throw an exception and the proposal in this jira for handling bad input starts with that assumption.,0

2298,OrtuJIRA_test_3,That said I had to do something similar in configurators and I did this by adding wrappers to the getInitParameter.,0

2329,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I agree with Sami that this should be contributed to Tika and that we delegate the language identification handling in Nutch to Tika just as we are doing or planning to for the MimeType and the parsing,0
2330,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Also I looked at first corrupted database that I posted  and found the corruption in the  index TEST1_IDX_INDCOL2.,0
2331,OrtuJIRA_test_3,I could not find any documented limits but if I missed them somewhere I will gladly put them in.,0
2332,OrtuJIRA_test_3,However I doubt that the same is true for MapContext because it is just a wrapper around a HashMap.,0

2334,OrtuJIRA_test_3,With hampered performance of sstableloader after 1.0 its made the things very difficult for us.,0

2347,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Also I'm slightly confused by your description because in section 5.8 of the spec it says that members of code_handler_class_RCN can be null.,0
2348,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Since I screwed up the commit we voted 2.1.7 down and are working to get 2.1.8 out pretty quickly.,0
2349,OrtuJIRA_test_3,A user looking at the set of changes won't care :),0

2389,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Should the forceSync be volatile?  Otherwise patch looks good (make it volatile on commit?),1

2391,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Thanks Andrew for covering me.,1
2392,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Looks excellent.  Really sweet.  + Where does the jar come from and whats its license? + The REST API  looks good.  Very RESTy.  There might be little nitpicks later but for it looks great.  How different is it from current REST.  Should the two be the same?  If not how to deprecate the old? + The annotations look interesting.  Could their serializations be used in other contexts the shell say?  Or -- warning -> crazy-thought coming -- somehow producing thrift IDL? + In hadoop/hbase line lengths are < 80 chars (Your new classes are missing apache license classes are missing comments describing what class is about etc). + Is there anything we could do refactoring HTable say so your modeling was easier?  Looks like lots of code in your Cell and Database controllers.   Should our client be taking on this model? + Can you add a note on how you've changed how REST works high-level?  Thats all for now.,1
2393,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Committed.  Thanks for the patch J-D,1

2411,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Well the fix looks good enough. Seems there is a lot of dead or half-broken code around st_print_frame() / exn_print_stack_trace() but those deserve good refactoring all in all.,1

2443,OrtuJIRA_test_4,Thanks Daryn I put this into trunk and branch-2,1
2444,OrtuJIRA_test_4,I committed the patch branch-1 also. Thank you Andy and Slavik.,1
2445,OrtuJIRA_test_4,That's great.  Thanks Junping.  Then I will first commit HADOOP-8820.b1.002.patch.  For the additional bug fixes let's create a new JIRA since we also need to fix the code in trunk.,1
2446,OrtuJIRA_test_4,I checked this into trunk branch-2 branch-2.1.0-alpha and branch-0.23.  Thanks Daryn for a quick fix to this.,1

2450,OrtuJIRA_test_4,+1 patch looks good.  Thanks a lot!,1
2451,OrtuJIRA_test_4,"""Thanks Tucu! You are right. I had not thought of that.  I'm on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast (so parallelizing is good). Like you already mentioned  bq. 1* Add a method in the FileSystem to disable its shutdown hook. MRAppMaster would disable it and call closeAll() explicitly (it already does). This is already present (by setting conf.setBoolean(""""fs.automatic.close"""" false) ) So I'm not sure what problem this JIRA is fixing. Or are we planning for the future? I'm fine with the latter answer being yes. I'm just curious.  The patch looks good for what it intends to do although the latest one doesn't include the fixes you made in response to Nicholas' comments.""",1

2458,OrtuJIRA_test_4,I've committed this to trunk and branch 22.  Thanks Nigel!  Tested via ant tar and ant package instead of Hudson since most of the change was done via svn remove (the patch only applies to build.xml).,1

2995,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for applying the images.   Please check and apply the patch I've submitted to FOR-1008 [1].

2999,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch applied. Thanks a lot especially for the test case. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240459&view=rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240461&view=rev  The result for 180 and -180 is definitely wrong. There's a bug that needs to be fixed eventually. But since this is low-priority for me I'm going to leave it for now. I've added a comment to the new test case block-container4a that explains what is wrong. So I think I'll close this issue. It's primarily for the patch after all and the bug won't be missed now that there is a check in our test suite. If anyone disagrees just reopen the issue or create a new one.,1
3000,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied.  Thanks Simon!,1
3001,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed rev:088067c. Thanks Roman!,1
3002,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think you should get rid of the open-ended version spec [1.2) as it occasionally screws things up by bringing in snapshots or non-working code. Otherwise to my eyes it looks good.,1

3005,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thank you Carol!,1
3006,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I took a quick look at D (unused locals).  Most of it looks good but I don't understand the few places where for backward compatibility there is what looks like a useless statement just to make sure a property gets read.  Won't someone else someday follow up with patch H that removes what seems to be useless code and just take those out anyway?,1
3007,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Re font size: sounds reasonable. Thanks.,1
3008,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for providing this update. WIll try to take a look at this sometime this week.,1
3009,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Agreed the current behavior is incorrect I just didn't want you disappointed. :-)  If you create your singleton jira patch before this one is applied then just include them together and close this bug.  I agree that commit rights would make this simpler and supplying patches is the primary way to gain commit rights so you are on the right path regardless what happens with Pax Web. :-),1
3010,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied thanks.,1
3011,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Alex.  It looks like a good path to solve this issue.,1
3012,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Yes we need to fix it. :),1
3013,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Ok thanks !  Closing the issue then.,1
3014,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thank you for the source code but why don't you also attach a diff file you get by running 'svn diff'?  It will help us figure out which part is changed exactly.  Thanks in advance!  Your idea sounds very good though. :D,1
3015,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks! Looks like a good clean-up to me. I admit I didn't check all the changed lines in detail but the approach gets my +1 :),1

3017,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the new patch Kim. +1,1
3018,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Knut and Rick thanks for your feedbacks. I will take care of the comments posted by Knut. Rick thanks for adding -lint directive it will be good to see the error from the compiler.,1
3019,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Tiago  Thanks for looking at this issue.  On visual inspection of the change your text change looks fine. However I can't apply the patch. You need to svn diff from the top of the tree show it shows the path staring with java/engine/...  You should reopen the issue until it has been committed.  Also just for good measure you should run suites.All and derbyall  in case there are any canon updates needed.  Thanks  Kathey,1
3020,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Changes look good. Could you run regression tests with your patch and let us know how it goes?  Thanks  Kathey,1
3021,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the new patch Kristian! The changes look good to me. +1 to commit.  A tiny nit in StatementPoolingTest,1

3023,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for double-checking the fix Knut. I am thinking of merging the fix into 10.3 tomorrow just to make sure that tests run fine on the tinderbox. All the tests ran fine on my machine.,1
3024,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Manjula I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null,1
3025,OrtuJIRA_test_5,All the regression tests ran cleanly with the patch. Committed revision 1126468.  Thanks for fix Ed!,1
3026,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This looks like a fine approach to me. Thanks for putting the patch together. +1.,1
3027,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Release note looks good.,1
3028,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch 3 looks good to me too. Thanks for all the work.,1
3029,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Bryan for converting these tests.  In using the DERBY-2152 conversion tool can you double check that it does not omit  the fail assert method after a method call in a try-catch block when the statement is expected to fail.  e.g. instead of   try {   s.execute(command),1
3030,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I was able to download and extract http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/docs-10.0.tar.gz just fine. Thanks for working on this Myrna.,1
3031,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Ramin  The patch looks good except I think it would be good to give import/export its own  SQLState starting with XIE instead of reusing the existing store FILE_EXISTS message.  Also it would be good to have test cases for writing the lob files.  Kathey,1
3032,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Knut Anders thanks for the review and the good advice.  The attached patch rmTestPreparedStatementMethods_v2.diff should address your comments.,1
3033,OrtuJIRA_test_5,These look just fine -- thanks for your hard work on all these fixes Dag! If they are technically correct I say +1 to commit.,1
3034,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the revision JÃ¸rgen! I think the release notes look good now. I will resolve the issue after a few days to allow for any feedback on Knut's suggestion.,1
3035,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks so much Knut Anders!,1
3036,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Anurag  Thanks for the preliminary peek at this patch. Looks good. I like the way you handled the optional inclusion of the JDBC4-specific classes in the jar file. I recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress. Thanks for the explanation of why you disabled the SecurityManager and for commenting the property file accordingly. When we do commit this patch let's leave the JIRA open to remind us to re-enable the SecurityManager after mustang fixes its bug.  Cheers-Rick,1
3037,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The patch looks good and the tests ran cleanly. I reindented some parts of the code since they had twice as much indentation as the surrounding code (does your editor use tab width eight instead of four?).  Committed revision 396859.,1
3038,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Anders   I agree with Knut  this issue can be marked as fixed   Thanks a lot for  working on this improvement.   -suresh,1
3039,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for taking the time out to review the patch Bryan. Yes the patch is ready for commit unless someone else is reviewing it too. Thanks again.,1
3040,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Kathey and Myrna. The release note looks good and it passes the ReleaseNoteReader's checks.,1
3041,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Great thanks!,1
3042,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed. Thanks for the patch :),1
3043,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Sounds perfect thank you.,1
3044,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Aki  I strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side which can expose the problem you mentioned and also verify your fix works.  Actually we already have ServerPersistenceTest and ClientPersistenceTest in systests/ws-specs I think you can add yours in those two classes.  Btw your suggestion seems ok for me.  Thanks Freeman,1
3045,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied patch into trunk and cxf-2.2.x branch  with thanks to William.,1
3046,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Charles thanks for the confirmation... We will chat with Willem I'm off today but will work for a couple of days this week... Sergey,1
3047,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've now ported the fix to 2.0.4 and deployed  a new snapshot.   Could someone give it a try to make sure it really is fixed so that we can close this off for 2.0.4?  Thanks!,1
3048,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch applied.  Thanks!,1
3049,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I'm excited to see progress being made here but I have to agree with Joan the security of this concerns me even with the new sandbox.js you're putting together.,1

3252,OrtuJIRA_test_5,+1 for the patch.,0
3253,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed to trunk.,0
3254,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Arpit!,0
3255,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think your logic is right.,0
3256,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This is what I understand.,0
3257,OrtuJIRA_test_5,1,0
3258,OrtuJIRA_test_5,FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.,0
3259,OrtuJIRA_test_5,2,0
3260,OrtuJIRA_test_5,FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.,0
3261,OrtuJIRA_test_5,3,0
3262,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In that case caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).,0
3263,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Logically this is also fine.,0
3264,OrtuJIRA_test_5,NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.,0
3265,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Caching is a specialized function.,0
3266,OrtuJIRA_test_5,So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.,0
3267,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But it may not be appropriate to add this in NativeFileSystem classes.,0
3268,OrtuJIRA_test_5,So the action items: 1. canDelete() canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.,0
3269,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please review and close out if appropriate.,0
3270,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This issue has been fixed by the Harmony-5834.,0
3271,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The testcase is helpful for ArrayList.,0
3272,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks very much for the contribution.,0
3273,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The fixing is available in all builds after r658561.,0
3274,OrtuJIRA_test_5,solved in subversion repository as of r818942.,0
3275,OrtuJIRA_test_5,patch applied with slight changes thanks for the report and thanks for the patch,0
3276,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the patch Gustavo.,0
3277,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I applied to 0.95 and trunk.,0
3278,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I thought there was already a (Hibernate specific?),0
3279,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"Some property which points to a ""DDL file"".",0
3280,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It might have meant to create a DB schema but perhaps you can just use it to do whatever migration activity that you are looking for?,0
3281,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please apply the attached patch by doing the following:  1.,0
3282,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Add the new file modules\java2wsdl\src\test\java\org\apache\tuscany\tools\java2wsdl\generate\ExampleService.java 2.,0
3283,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Apply the changes in patch1658 3.,0
3284,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Unzip ws-void-args-return under the itest directory 4.,0
3285,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Update the pom for itest to include ws-void-args-return  This patch fixes TUSCANY-1658 and TUSCANY-1653 and add an itest to verify the fix.,0
3286,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It also includes a corresponding change in java2wsdl to handle the two-way void return case correctly.,0
3287,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied patch.,0
3288,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks!,0
3289,OrtuJIRA_test_5,+1 looks good.,0
3290,OrtuJIRA_test_5,One final note the error handling should have its own JIRA so that it is addressed one day?,0
3291,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Oh and that wiki page for the shell is slightly formatted wrong by the looks it changes to cursive/italics and stays until the end.,0
3292,OrtuJIRA_test_5,And the .irbrc sample output has no line breaks and makes it difficult to read it.,0
3293,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Fix race conditions in Balancer.,0
3294,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Contributed by Junping Du (szetszwo: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1532932) * /hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/CHANGES.txt * /hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/balancer/Balancer.java,0
3295,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied the patch to implement Workspace.move,0
3296,OrtuJIRA_test_5,We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).,0
3297,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I only needed to let MarkupResourceStream also implement it.,0
3298,OrtuJIRA_test_5,And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is  I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.,0
3299,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It seems to work fine for me when i test locally the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through  cachekey -> locationstring -> markup  So if locationString doesn't work we get this:  cachekey -> cachekey -> markup  But i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...  should we include this into 1.3.2?,0
3300,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Tatyana - the third patch was applied to BTI branch 2.0 at r552655.,0
3301,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please check that the patch was applied as you expected and close the issue if everything is OK for you.,0
3302,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Sebastian as Sonar calls the cobertura maven plugin there is not much we can do.,0
3303,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Until the patch gets applied you might want to use Emma as coverage engine with the Sonar Emma Plugin (or Clover but it is free only for a month),0
3304,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Matt  Encrypting the serialized component tree will not solve the problem of stale view state.,0
3305,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The Sun JSF-RI team have implemented a fix for this issue.,0
3306,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It will be available in 1.2_05.,0
3307,OrtuJIRA_test_5,See the following link for more info:  https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=612  Thanks Ian,0
3308,OrtuJIRA_test_5,the configuration in the POM works fine with 2.4.3.,0
3309,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch applied on 2.1.x 2.2.x and trunk,0
3310,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Just an update:  # SOLR-1131: aka poly fields is almost ready to go.,0
3311,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please review.,0
3312,OrtuJIRA_test_5,# SOLR-1297: sort by function query just needs review and then can be committed.,0
3313,OrtuJIRA_test_5,After that we can add in the Cartesian Tier indexing and the Cartesian Tier QParserPlugin (after a little re-write).,0
3314,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Then we need pseudo-fields and we likely  want to hook in a per request function cache (maybe),0
3315,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.,0
3316,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.,0
3317,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I will post my results when the tests finish.,0
3318,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.,0
3319,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.,0
3320,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".",0
3321,OrtuJIRA_test_5,o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class.,0
3322,OrtuJIRA_test_5,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,0
3323,OrtuJIRA_test_5,However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.,0
3324,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.,0
3325,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.,0
3326,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.,0
3327,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.,0
3328,OrtuJIRA_test_5,SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.,0
3329,OrtuJIRA_test_5,That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).,0
3330,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().,0
3331,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.,0
3332,OrtuJIRA_test_5,If so then I would recommend adding a third index.,0
3333,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table.,0
3334,OrtuJIRA_test_5,See for instance the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.,0
3335,OrtuJIRA_test_5,SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table.,0
3336,OrtuJIRA_test_5,DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.,0
3337,OrtuJIRA_test_5,EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.,0
3338,OrtuJIRA_test_5,DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods.,0
3339,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks -Rick,0
3340,OrtuJIRA_test_5,See previous comments for earlier commit.,0
3341,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This one fixes the end-date issue in the comment bean classes: URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=782269&view=rev  And that resolves this issue in the trunk.,0
3342,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Greg!,0
3343,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hey Chrisyou just moved the files right?!,0
3344,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Vinicus patch only includes a single file (the failing junit) all Uwe need to do is to apply the patch to the moved file is that correct?,0
3345,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Also applies to the 4.x series,0
3346,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The behaviour still occurs in the last snapshot using both Mojarra 2.1 or MyFaces.,0
3347,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Attribute 'width' works fine.,0
3348,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Would be nice to have a batch/list functionality as well like we have for deletes/puts.,0
3349,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Are there any (future?),0
3350,OrtuJIRA_test_5,plans to have a multi- version of the atomicMutation?,0
3351,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.,0
3352,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs.,0
3353,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!,0
3354,OrtuJIRA_test_5,We should use a more efficient in-memory representation for such range mappings.,0
3355,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In the same pc I have a outlook client and It work fine the problem is with xplanner how can I  configurate xplanner for send mails ?,0
3356,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks,0
3357,OrtuJIRA_test_5,ok I'm looking into this.,0
3358,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Okay reviewed and tested patch with sqlite3 and bdb on trunk.,0
3359,OrtuJIRA_test_5,One minor correction to configure without sqlite3.,0
3360,OrtuJIRA_test_5,$Name,0
3361,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Have a look at hibernate.common.xml,0
3362,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi David  This helps me understand what you were talking about - thanks!,0
3363,OrtuJIRA_test_5,(Things weren't as clear at 2am ))    Yes we should probably definitely be removing the ThreadLocal entirely.,0
3364,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I'll make those changes as soon as I can.,0
3365,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi there,0
3366,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch applied in trunk.,0
3367,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have added some buttons to help put variables and patterns.,0
3368,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thank you for your contribution.,0
3369,OrtuJIRA_test_5,applies to trunk too,0
3370,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single ""around"" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml.",0
3371,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree) when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?,0
3372,OrtuJIRA_test_5,You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.,0
3373,OrtuJIRA_test_5,There are no extra lines of code or maintenance it is the simplest solution.,0
3374,OrtuJIRA_test_5,As long as the change is applied at build time I don't see any real drawback.,0
3375,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Ah ok ... thanks for the heads up.,0
3376,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"There's a note on the main page about these scripts but you're right: nothing obvious in some of hte ""sub pages""  I'll take a stab at clarifying.",0
3377,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Changes to the test look good and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.,0
3378,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.,0
3379,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.,0
3380,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.,0
3381,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).,0
3382,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.,0
3383,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.,0
3384,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've also started to add cascading configuration.,0
3385,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.,0
3386,OrtuJIRA_test_5,ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).,0
3387,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.,0
3388,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.,0
3389,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This allows for a two-phase rendering.,0
3390,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Apply isn't the best name but we're already using update() so suggestions welcome.,0
3391,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.,0
3392,OrtuJIRA_test_5,These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand.,0
3393,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied patch,0
3394,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Would anyone have time to put together a pull request?,0
3395,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Preben  I just applied the your patch with a minor modification on FtpConsumerWithCharsetTest.testConsumerWithCharset to use UTF_8 charset by default.,0
3396,OrtuJIRA_test_5,For the CAMEL-3787 I think the key should be on the ftp client configure to find out right charset that the server is using.,0
3397,OrtuJIRA_test_5,> MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE)   Use strict mode instead of browser compatibility.,0
3398,OrtuJIRA_test_5,936-2 wasn't patching correctly against the latest flume-728 so here's an updated patchfile now that 935 is available.,0
3399,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Tests pass but there is some weirdness going on with rat failing on licenses because it tries to examine the surefire reports...,0
3400,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for supplying the patch.,0
3401,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have applied it in Rev.,0
3402,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please close this bug if this is ok for you.,0
3403,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I showed my interest on this idea in the dev-mailing list and currently started to explore the requirements and a design.,0
3404,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Applied Patch..,0
3405,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks,0
3406,OrtuJIRA_test_5,OK will open the issue with Solr/Lucene.,0
3407,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This patch has been around for a while.,0
3408,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Does this applies to 0.22 trunk or 0.23 trunk?,0
3409,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks.,0
3410,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I found the note in the manual about @Resource and that fixes it.,0
3411,OrtuJIRA_test_5,At this point I'd suggest  peppering the docs with references to @Resource wherever it discusses autowiring things or about collections.,0
3412,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"E.g. ""note: if you're trying to auto wire a collection with annotations you'll need to use @Resource instead of @Autowired"".",0
3413,OrtuJIRA_test_5,patch committed in rev 942983 thanks!,0
3414,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I looked at all the TODO's in uimaj-core and found only one Sofa-related exception that needed update.,0

3419,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed revision 816738.,0
3420,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior,0
3421,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Could you please verify and/or adapt your patch against the current version at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/jcs/branches/generics-interface I was not able to apply your patch there.,0
3422,OrtuJIRA_test_5,A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.,0
3423,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Such a class does not really need an {{apply}} method.,0
3424,OrtuJIRA_test_5,However as a tactical decision imposed by the implementation of the typechecker we will require a matching {{apply}} method for every {{set}} method and will reassess this issue later in the context of a possible typechecker redesign.,0
3425,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Pull request available here:  https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-roo/pull/8  The changes are minor.,0
3426,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I discovered that it works fine with command line.,0
3427,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But it does not work when I try it using maven integration plugin for eclipse.,0
3428,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have open a ticket on their side: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNGECLIPSE-1054,0
3429,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I would rather not have specific vendor JDK names listed in there if can be avoided anyway.,0
3430,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Not sure when it was added.,0
3431,OrtuJIRA_test_5,worth investigating.,0
3432,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed to branch-2.1-beta branch-2 and trunk.,0
3433,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the patch Andr?Ã¶!,0
3434,OrtuJIRA_test_5,+1 the branch-1 patch looks good.,0
3435,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This reviewable and I think also committable.,0
3436,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the patch.,0
3437,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Committed to 0.8 after reverting the change in system_test/ (the consumer property file there is used for an 0.7 consumer).,0
3438,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Verified patch applied as expected.,0
3439,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Dyre thanks for your comments.,0
3440,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have made a new patch derby-2108-v4.diff which have incorporated (most of) your commets.,0
3441,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think I'm ready for commit soon.,0
3442,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I did a change to BULIDING.txt adding ${j14lib}/security.jar to java14compile.classpath in the description of how to build with IBM JDK.,0
3443,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have not verified that it works and hope someone would confirm that it's correct.,0
3444,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Jacopo  Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.,0
3445,OrtuJIRA_test_5,David  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful especially for larger businesses.,0
3446,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.,0
3447,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.,0
3448,OrtuJIRA_test_5,However I also run into the opposite problem.,0
3449,OrtuJIRA_test_5,For my larger suppliers I will often have a 100 or more requirements built up.,0
3450,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"Since the ""Approved Requirements"" screen paginates the requirements I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier simply because the application operates a page at a time.",0
3451,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This annoys my suppliers a bit.,0
3452,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate) but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).,0
3453,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This should have been fixed by commit 26a5b76ee6b77909a7b8d5b00924f12e1671373d.,0
3454,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Verified on my vmware setup extract volume is working fine now.,0
3455,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I did that first but then remembered that when I did that in the past people were unable to apply my patches w/o doing the svn move themselves.,0
3456,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Anyway for this file it's not really important I think - a very simple and tiny file w/ no history to preserve?,0
3457,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please keep this open until reverse tests are configured as we might have new issues coming from them.,0
3458,OrtuJIRA_test_5,+1 on patch.,0
3459,OrtuJIRA_test_5,@Andrei: Please re-attach patch using --no-prefix option.,0
3460,OrtuJIRA_test_5,HadoopQA uses -p0 to apply patches.,0
3461,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Ok got it thanks for the explanation.,0
3462,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In any case the code for the toBytes method is written now so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.,0
3463,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.,0
3464,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But yeah that's for another JIRA.,0
3465,OrtuJIRA_test_5,An example patch.,0
3466,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Was unable to run the unit test I wrote (because my setup is being a jerk) but I'm more looking for input on the design.,0
3467,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for the reviews committed the patch to trunk,0
3468,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Zdenek  Thank you for working with these components.,0
3469,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I seem to be having trouble applying the patches though and I'd hate for all these corrections and improvements to be lost.,0
3470,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Do you think you could submit a new patch in a single file (perhaps named with the current date) based on the current SVN head ?,0
3471,OrtuJIRA_test_5,That would really help a lot.,0
3472,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Rest of Ender's patch was applied.,0
3473,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It is good to know that pluto has a problem here but I realy need servlets integrated pluto.,0
3474,OrtuJIRA_test_5,@Arnaud: My key looks exactly the same and was generated with Cygwin's ss-keygen.,0
3475,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The file has Unix line endings though ...  @Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27).,0
3476,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Do the same tests work fine on 1.5.0dev?,0
3477,OrtuJIRA_test_5,One of the things I changed in jnr-posix was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.,0
3478,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime ctime mtime fields).,0
3479,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Otherwise the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end which are not part of the windows stat64 struct so will probably be filled with either zero or garbage.,0
3480,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Awesome. Thats great to hear!,0
3481,OrtuJIRA_test_5,{quote}  Hmm looks like the backport blew away scrubtest on 1.2 as well.,0
3482,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Oversight?,0
3483,OrtuJIRA_test_5,{quote} Yes was an oversight.,0
3484,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Just for clarification skipBloomFilters is old.,0
3485,OrtuJIRA_test_5,#1 and #2 are incorrect.,0
3486,OrtuJIRA_test_5,1: The skipBloomFilters gets called on the index file in RowIndexEntry line 104.,0
3487,OrtuJIRA_test_5,2: In 2.0 the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable also the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing.,0
3488,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I made a preliminary patch to share the idea how this can be fixed.,0
3489,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"- This fix works if I run a ""mahout"" from command line against a Hadoop cluster.",0
3490,OrtuJIRA_test_5,A unit test case doesn't work -Dkey=value is not parsed in ToolRunner but passed through to SparseVectorsFromSequenceFiles resulting in a parse error.,0
3491,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Did I make any mistake?,0
3492,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Maybe because a JUnit doesn't really mimic a real hadoop env?,0
3493,OrtuJIRA_test_5,great. awesome job sergey!,0
3494,OrtuJIRA_test_5,IMHO Configuration should be the first or the the last arguments.,0
3495,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It looks like there is something about the build scripts that is causing it because hdfs.proto where NameSpaceInfoProto is defined is more or less identical between trunk and branch-2.,0
3496,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Looking forward to using it.,0
3497,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I just committed this.,0

3499,OrtuJIRA_test_5,+1  Patch looks nice.,0

3502,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Resolving as fixed.,0
3503,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I ran it on current trunk.,0
3504,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It successfully gets the expected exception but then fails to close FSNamesystem with NPE.,0
3505,OrtuJIRA_test_5,So yes it fails but not where you wanted it to.,0
3506,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Please open using the JIra workflow and fill in the details.,0
3507,OrtuJIRA_test_5,we improved hash handling in Railo but we get not the same result with non ascii characters as ACF (with ascii characters everything is fine).,0
3508,OrtuJIRA_test_5,we cannot find a problem in our implementation anymore perhaps there is a problem in he ACF implementation that force a other resultat.,0
3509,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This looks like it might be a blocker for release.,0

3531,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Hi Colm   My comments are the same see above: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CODEC-161?focusedCommentId=13485148&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13485148  I've not gone through to see if you've addresses any of comments but a quick scan shows that you did not pick up 2 and 3 so I'll wait for the next version of the patch,1
3532,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Hi Gary I think I have a rather nice and elegant patch for this,1
3533,OrtuJIRA_test_6,abhi  can this be assigned to someone  thanks /sudha,1
3534,OrtuJIRA_test_6,"""> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback.  I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford """"published"""" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so """"experiments"""" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that """"black box feeling"""" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). """,1

3550,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Looking at DataStax's 2.0.0 Debian packages the change didn't make its way in.  Digging deeper it's only on the cassandra-1.2 branch.  Can someone merge/cherry-pick it to cassandra-2.0 and trunk.  Thanks Blair,1

3559,OrtuJIRA_test_6,{quote} Totally didn't know we support IN for DELETE.   Would prefer to fix by offering IN for for the other statements as well. The Antlr doesn't look too daunting w/ DELETE as an example (knock on wood). Can take a stab at that tomorrow. {quote}  This is {{multiget_slice()}} / {{multiget_count()}} and was intentionally omitted (remember?).  Not saying this is decision that can't be revisited just reminding.  Oh and if we do move forward it's post-0.8 we're in a feature-freeze. :),1
3560,OrtuJIRA_test_6,The v4 changes look good. Thanks,1
3561,OrtuJIRA_test_6,LGTM +1 (and I think I'm sufficiently convinced that it's OK for 0.7.1 as well).  I think tjake was planning to commit this so I'll leave it here for the time being until he has a chance to look it over.  Thanks Stephen.,1
3562,OrtuJIRA_test_6,+1 Thanks!,1
3563,OrtuJIRA_test_6,This looks good to me.,1
3564,OrtuJIRA_test_6,+1 This patch looks good. Let's remove from 0.4 and work on a better implementation on 0.5,1
3565,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Well if it is just a documentation bug even better. Thanks for the clarification.,1
3566,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Good suggestion Claus and thanks Alexander for the fast realization.,1
3567,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Applied the patch into trunk with thanks to Luca after minor refactoring.,1
3568,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Thanks guys!,1
3569,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Thanks for the patch.,1
3570,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I'll look into the namespace handler. Thanks.  Yes I should have added the different event handling support to the TODO above. I need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more. Using just the endpoint api I couldn't create routes on the fly hence the polling consumer approach.  I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems. Everything repeats itself :),1
3571,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Hi Willem  I've just tried the latest version from the trunk. Now everything works like a charm. Thank you very much for such a great help.  Regards Sergey,1

3584,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Thanks Ivan. I'll do the changes by just return if it matches as you suggested. I'll investigate it later.  bq.Auditor will be a top level daemon so it should own its create it's own LedgerManagers and ZooKeeper client. The only thing passed in to is should be the configuration.  Anyway we are planning to have initialization class which does starting Auditor and RW threads. Would you agree to create ledgerManagers there and pass it to the Auditor and RW daemons?  In that case shall I keep the ctor as it is. (by taking managers)  {code} public Auditor(String bookieIdentifier AbstractConfiguration conf             ZooKeeper zkc LedgerManager ledgerManager             LedgerUnderreplicationManager ledgerUnderreplicationManager) { {code},1

3878,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Yes it seems that in some cases the exceptions are swallowed and e.printStackTrace() is heavily used.,0
3879,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Yes You are right [~jiannan] If the {{bkActiveLedgersSnapshot}} contains ledgers which are > {{lRange.end()}} then there is no chance of being gc'ed in the current gc call.,0
3880,OrtuJIRA_test_6,But if one more ledger is created then on next gc call all ledgers deleted ( which are having lesser ledgerId than latest created) will be gc'ed.,0

3911,OrtuJIRA_test_6,(review board is helpful).,0
3912,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Mind adding some comments explaining why this is ok to retry?,0
3913,OrtuJIRA_test_6,(We are retrying once and if we fail twice we give up).,0
3914,OrtuJIRA_test_6,It seems strange to me that we are retrying something that throws a DoNotRetyIOException.,0

4034,OrtuJIRA_test_6,patch to add DynamicAttributesHandler and update SimpleTheme AbstractCommonAttributesTest and AbstractTest,0
4035,OrtuJIRA_test_6,"re: ""should remain"" - yes I vote it should remain but be more flexible",0
4036,OrtuJIRA_test_6,If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.,-1
4037,OrtuJIRA_test_6,It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though.,-1
4038,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.,-1
4039,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Currently the user passwords are too insecure.,-1
4040,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.,-1
4041,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm!,-1
4042,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry I thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch.,-1
4043,OrtuJIRA_test_6,It's kind of annoying to have to use 4GB of temporary space  Nope it only writes the compressed file to disk {{gzip -1}} compresses 4GB of zeros to 18 MiB.,-1
4044,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I don't have very much experience on branch-1 would you like to take a shot at the port?,-1
4045,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Especially I don't know very much about the test framework differences.,-1
4046,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you don't get to it first.,-1
4047,OrtuJIRA_test_6,sorry unassigning myself from this backport.,-1
4048,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Another backport (for a different jira) of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport.,-1
4049,OrtuJIRA_test_6,To upgrade to a recent version of Jackrabbit see http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/BackupAndMigration I'm afraid I can't say much about the risk.,-1
4050,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I've tried something similar (I removed the handlers and kept the readers) but the performance was not visible.,-1
4051,OrtuJIRA_test_6,The responder seemed to be a bottleneck.,-1
4052,OrtuJIRA_test_6,But it was not the only issue: we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities.,-1
4053,OrtuJIRA_test_6,While creating the DerbyTest I did notice that this problem is caused by the Database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background.,-1
4054,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry [~fiberlijun] - havent had a chance to look at it yet.,-1
4055,OrtuJIRA_test_6,(I could not get what KEYWORD means.),-1
4056,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I am checking out the dojo fixes and patching them in sorry for the delay it has been a long time,-1
4057,OrtuJIRA_test_6,> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this.,-1
4058,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Seems to be failing for a different reason now  testContainerLaunch(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.TestLinuxContainerExecutorWithMocks)  Time elapsed: 0.523 sec  <<< FAILURE!,-1
4059,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry for all the issue mails I forgot to mention the second:  2) There is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed?,-1
4060,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I'm very sorry.,-1
4061,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.,-1
4062,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I should have been very careful before doing this.,-1
4063,OrtuJIRA_test_6,My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch... Resubmitting in a second.,-1
4064,OrtuJIRA_test_6,*sorry*,-1
4065,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Damn.,-1
4066,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Git is tricky that way.,-1
4067,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sigh I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.,-1
4068,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.,-1
4069,OrtuJIRA_test_6,You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.,-1
4070,OrtuJIRA_test_6,This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.,-1
4071,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side....,-1
4072,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.,-1
4073,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry Chris  I missed it done !,-1
4074,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I don't think there is any sense in this who cares?,-1
4075,OrtuJIRA_test_6,We reported this crash to Oracle in plenty of time and the *worse* wrong-results bug has been open since May 13: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7044738 but Oracle decided not to fix that too.,-1
4076,OrtuJIRA_test_6,One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved.,-1
4077,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I'm very busy for the moment so I didn't know when I 'd be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated.,-1
4078,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Oh I didn't consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately #store failed.,-1
4079,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.,-1
4080,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't) what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?,-1
4081,OrtuJIRA_test_6,You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.,-1
4082,OrtuJIRA_test_6,You would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms.,-1
4083,OrtuJIRA_test_6,And the current behavior is irritating.,-1
4084,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload.,-1
4085,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIB Not sure where this should go ...,-1
4086,OrtuJIRA_test_6,i found the class - so there is no bug - sorry,-1
4087,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I was not aware of being required to call that method.,-1
4088,OrtuJIRA_test_6,This is a silly one.,-1
4089,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs.,-1
4090,OrtuJIRA_test_6,The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.,-1
4091,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this.,-1
4092,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner.,-1
4093,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.,-1
4094,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry for the delay.,-1
4095,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.,-1
4096,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it),-1
4097,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE-5864,-1
4098,OrtuJIRA_test_6,but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application  My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.,-1
4099,OrtuJIRA_test_6,App developers never do what they should :),-1
4100,OrtuJIRA_test_6,"problem - the bit to sign the source-release is being called when the source-release isn't being built because the source-release is only built at the ""executionroot"".",-1
4101,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Excuse me for stolen assignement.,-1
4102,OrtuJIRA_test_6,In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.,-1
4103,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Must be: size >= 0!,-1
4104,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry for the missing class src/java/org/apache/jdo/tck/lifecycle/StateTransitionsReturnedObjects.java.,-1
4105,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry if this was not clear and yes by <blank> I meant an empty string.,-1
4106,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh,-1
4107,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Hi Guillaume  I did not have an answer right away so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol.,-1
4108,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Sorry should have commented on this much sooner.,-1
4109,OrtuJIRA_test_6,It is not yet tested - I ran into strange build problems with APR.,-1
4110,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.,-1
4111,OrtuJIRA_test_6,"Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ""ordered - cancelled = quantity"" which equates to ""1 - 1 = 0"".",-1
4112,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.,-1
4113,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Please ignore attachment (id=6938).,-1
4114,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks.,1
4115,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Looking forward to your patch.,1
4116,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks for the info David.,1
4117,OrtuJIRA_test_7,That is useful advice (call me biased if you'd like).,1
4118,OrtuJIRA_test_7,HI Anahita  Your patch tested successfully.,1
4119,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I think this is pretty close to being ready.,1
4120,OrtuJIRA_test_7,It's great to see you've gotten the ball rolling Chris.,1
4121,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I'll be happy to edit the wiki when I get this resolved!,1
4122,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hi John  I would agree using object notification is probably a cleaner way to do this.,1
4123,OrtuJIRA_test_7,> - FOUserAgent.getStream() is cool and very easy to use (now that it's properly > documented).,1
4124,OrtuJIRA_test_7,"i kinda like the black acctually .. but that may largely be due to my prefering the ""fire"" solr logo over the futuristic magnifying glass (the red/orange contrasts nicely with the black/grey.  to my mind the ""Solr"" ""Sun"" connection has allways been really cool ...",1
4125,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Awesome discussion.,1
4126,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Got it thanks for the explanation.,1

4132,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I've just tested the shiro trunk with karaf-2.2 release and everything works fine :),1
4133,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Pretty sure this was fixed by the time we released JRuby 1.6.,1
4134,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Interesting I just replaced my src with the latest in the trunk and did a compleatly clean build and the problem seems to have gone away.,1
4135,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This is Awesome Stefan - thanks a million!,1

4157,OrtuJIRA_test_7,"Waaaaay cool! I especially like the ""upload file"" option.",1
4158,OrtuJIRA_test_7,cool stuff! a good candidate to put on myfaces-commons-utils so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp faces-config.,1
4159,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks Daryn!,1
4160,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks for the reviews..,1
4161,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Wow thanks Raghu that's awesome and will save me a ton of time.,1

4174,OrtuJIRA_test_7,v2 Looks good to me.,1
4175,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hey you're right that idea was probably not the best approach to the problem - 0.6 looks really nice looking forward to it :),1
4176,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks for moving so quickly on this guys.,1
4177,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks Sanjay!,1
4178,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Cool thanks Daniel we're actually cool with either updating it to e9ff8c4928 or flipping the write bit and we'll push the delta ourselves - whatever's the fastest to get to writeable:)  Thanks --tim,1
4179,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This is a great suggestion.,1
4180,OrtuJIRA_test_7,great thanks Joel.,1
4181,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks for reporting solved!,1
4182,OrtuJIRA_test_7,it belongs to faces 1.2 :),1
4183,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp  There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :),1
4184,OrtuJIRA_test_7,cool no worries.,1
4185,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Cool feature!  Performance:  - It looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again (eval) for every update request.,1
4186,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks Ram  That seems like a definite improvement.,1
4187,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly-named operations.,1
4188,OrtuJIRA_test_7,It's OK.,1
4189,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hi Suran  The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.,1
4190,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Nice feature lars!!,1
4191,OrtuJIRA_test_7,:)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.,1

4193,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.,1
4194,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sounds like a good idea.,1
4195,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Many thanks for your help.,1
4196,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thank you!,1
4197,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I've tested them out and everything is fine.,1
4198,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already) :),1
4199,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks once again.,1

4292,OrtuJIRA_test_7,So i'm going to make a patch that does 1G regions and 128M flushes (with the multiplier still of x2 so we'll grow to 256M before the barrier comes down).,0
4293,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Any objections?,0
4294,OrtuJIRA_test_7,(A 2GB memstore flush is fine when lzo is on but we want something for default).,0

4312,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Looks good.,0
4313,OrtuJIRA_test_7,+1  Looks good to me.,0
4314,OrtuJIRA_test_7,As far as I understand the specification [/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/17/66/ea/1766eaef-f0f5-4cf6-95ef-a1d7290257f9] is not a legal name:  http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/6_Query.html#6.7.4 Name  Name ::= '[' quotedName ']' | '[' simpleName ']' | simpleName ::= /* A JCR Name that is also a legal SQL identifier 10 */ 10 See the SQL:92 rules for <regular identifier> (in ISO/IEC 9075:1992 ââ5.2 <token> and <separator>).,0
4315,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Too bad :( What ff we could check C-heap lock state before forking and possibly switch to an alternative way?,0
4316,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Because of this and HADOOP-4972 it may makes sense to acquire namesystem locks in getBlockLocationsInternal.,0

4323,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I'm no pom expert but it seems that unqualified pom variables can cause this problem.,0
4324,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Attached is a patch to support those variables.,0
4325,OrtuJIRA_test_7,correct build status capture echo's exit code,0
4326,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Paulex the original patch seems to be out-of-date.,0
4327,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks,0
4328,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I tend to doubt there's anything we can do about this if the problem is at a lower level.,0
4329,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This file demonstrates the problem described in this bug.,0
4330,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The expected behavior would be to see the following messages on stdout.,0
4331,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This script renames the files like follows:  cd modules/lang-management/src/test/impl/java/org/apache/harmony/lang/management svn move DynamicMXBeanImplTest.java DynamicMXBeanImplTestBase.java svn move SingleInstanceDynamicMXBeanImplTest.java SingleInstanceDynamicMXBeanImplTestBase.java svn move MultiInstanceDynamicMXBeanImplTest.java MultiInstanceDynamicMXBeanImplTestBase.java  Run it please from classlib base directory.,0
4332,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I respectfully disagree with your interpretation even though in most of the cases it corresponds to what the majority of users may expect to see (including myself).,0
4333,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This said HttpClient is a general purpose HTTP agent and as such should follow the letter of the specification rather than make informed guesses.,0
4334,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We are not supposed to invent stuff.,0
4335,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Nowhere in the spec 'circular redirects' are mentioned.,0
4336,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The spec states that an HTTP agent should avoid infinite loops which is not the same thing as circular redirects in my opinion.,0
4337,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I saw this recently when using a custom built ActiveMQ (5.0.0.9-fuse) with ServiceMix (3.2.1).,0

4349,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Makes sense to me.,0
4350,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We have equalsIgnoreCase so having that ability for EqualsBuilder (and therefore HashCodeBuilder) seems apt.,0

4359,OrtuJIRA_test_7,[~ikelly] are you trying the right patch?,0
4360,OrtuJIRA_test_7,the new patch already put the #resolveConflict after checking ensemble.,0
4361,OrtuJIRA_test_7,oh I looked closely to see if you flipped args or did a compare w/ a presumption that hadn't been testing a statement or two earlier and it all looks right to me.,0
4362,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I had a quick look at the ab patch and nothing jumped at me.,0
4363,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Two small nits though:    * the count variable in requireAtLeastOneProperty() is never used    * couldntSetProperty() reinvents Property.toString() (or actually Hashtable.toString() which is inherited by Property),0
4364,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Please check that the patch was applied as you expected.,0
4365,OrtuJIRA_test_7,+1 Looks good  I just committed this.,0
4366,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I addressed all of them in a new version of the patch.,0
4367,OrtuJIRA_test_7,do we really need this?,0
4368,OrtuJIRA_test_7,the current command is modeled after the export shell command.,0
4369,OrtuJIRA_test_7,export x=y sets the variable.,0
4370,OrtuJIRA_test_7,export with no args prints all the current settings.,0
4371,OrtuJIRA_test_7,we are missing an equivalent of export -n (to unset stuff).,0
4372,OrtuJIRA_test_7,if this is not a good model - then we should switch it with something different altogether.,0
4373,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Well 4762 is going nowhere fast should we push this to 2.1 as well?,0
4374,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This should have been fixed already.,0
4375,OrtuJIRA_test_7,EventListeners and CacheLoaders are documented.,0
4376,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Only peerProviders and some tutorial left to do.,0
4377,OrtuJIRA_test_7,XW-172 already talked about number conversion and localization.,0
4378,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry I didn't see that before creating this issue.,0

4382,OrtuJIRA_test_7,fixed in revision 413841 Boris please check that it was applied as expected,0
4383,OrtuJIRA_test_7,At the very least the exception could explain what the problem is rather than what the state of an obscure private variable is.,0

4394,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hmmm... it's not collisions then it was worth a try.,0
4395,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I still find the difference puzzling -- I can't justify your version being 3x faster.,0
4396,OrtuJIRA_test_7,But we know a lot about docids and extra hashing should just lead to an average-case slowdown.,0

4402,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Have you got a link regarding the classpath exception and ASL2 compatibliity?,0
4403,OrtuJIRA_test_7,For the authentication issue it's recorded in JAMES-1418 (I will try to look at it this weekend).,0
4404,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thank you.,0
4405,OrtuJIRA_test_7,So I added a comment out on UnInvertedField.,0
4406,OrtuJIRA_test_7,For the second issue: Consider long tailed distribution as shown on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail  (In case of network traffic.,0
4407,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The biggest 90% data volume comes comes from less then 10% of connections.),0
4408,OrtuJIRA_test_7,In this case we have extremely wide spread __important__ values with only ___single_ occurrences.,0
4409,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If we want to generate similar variable (for ex.,0
4410,OrtuJIRA_test_7,larger sample) we'll get fixed values for all this bins in the long tail.,0
4411,OrtuJIRA_test_7,It signifies 10% of generated values will be __fixed_ values - their respective bin means!,0
4412,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Last Issue: I would question usage of Gaussian Kernel at all.,0
4413,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Without having a mathematical prove I nevertheless suppose it could disturb parameters of generation if we have non Gaussian empirical data.,0
4414,OrtuJIRA_test_7,(for ex.,0
4415,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Pareto Tweedie ..)  Why we don't stick with triangular or uniform distribution as default for Kernel within the bean?,0
4416,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The apache vhost has been setup but still needs some work.,0
4417,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Right now it will proxy to port 80 of the httpd instance running on the current VM.,0
4418,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Is this sufficient?,0
4419,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Does nexus check for https connections for anything?,0
4420,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Does it care at all?,0
4421,OrtuJIRA_test_7,[~sershe] please bear with me - (1) could you please upload a rebased patch.,0
4422,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The patch is horribly out-of-date.,0
4423,OrtuJIRA_test_7,(2) HDFS-4979 introduced RetryCache in the NameNode.,0
4424,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Not sure if it is reasonable - is it possible to use the classes from HDFS-4979 here.,0
4425,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Committed to branch.,0
4426,OrtuJIRA_test_7,An email snafooey caused us to update our JIRA instance to 6.1 before we had a chance to test the import on our test instance (it didn't work properly for those who tried to whack at it).,0
4427,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We have a guy looking into getting it in shape now but it will require you to update your current JIRA instance to 6.1 before doing another export for us.,0
4428,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience but JIRA is really strict about the versions being equal when doing an import.,0
4429,OrtuJIRA_test_7,So good news is we finally have a chance of testing the exports very soon bad news is it will require an update on your side to be able to transfer the spark JIRA data.,0
4430,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I hope you can figure out how to upgrade and if you have any questions or need help feel free to reach out to us.,0
4431,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Soundararajan Ning - Yes I am planning on working on it starting next week.,0
4432,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I expect this to take at least upto mid to late in the week in order to get a patch available for this.,0
4433,OrtuJIRA_test_7,However if that schedule does not work for you please feel free to take this issue into your queue and go ahead.,0
4434,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Alexei this patch is quite out of date (sorry about that).,0
4435,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Please can you provide an updated patch?,0
4436,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks Tim,0
4437,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow then in the metatables doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent we'd have to scan to the next row).,0
4438,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If we redid the meta tables in this format we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase a scan as opposed to the perverse expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.,0
4439,OrtuJIRA_test_7,This issue is about changing the way we name regions.,0
4440,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If we were using scans prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).,0
4441,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Converting to the new method we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.,0
4442,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Up to this the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation.,0
4443,OrtuJIRA_test_7,"HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region.",0
4444,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.,0
4445,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The two machines do not share the filesystem.,0
4446,OrtuJIRA_test_7,There is an embedded Tomcat running in the same JVM but according to the logs the database is not booted twice.,0
4447,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts.,0
4448,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Ah and I am running 10.2 SVN 540841 as this fixes DERBY-2549.,0
4449,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hmmm..,0
4450,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Dojo [0] and Ext.js [1] take both a different approach (which i personally don't really like).,0
4451,OrtuJIRA_test_7,just wanted to mention it as it's not about my personal preference but rather what is considered most useful for everybody.,0
4452,OrtuJIRA_test_7,[0] http://dojotoolkit.org/~dylan/dojo/tests/widget/demo_DatePicker.html [1] http://extjs.com/deploy/ext/examples/form/dynamic.html (3rd form),0
4453,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Aaron: I completely agree the parser needs to be changed but I don't currently have the time available.,0
4454,OrtuJIRA_test_7,My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work.,0
4455,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If you're ok with that I think another jira should switch the parser.,0
4456,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Todd: I suppose it comes down to whether hadoop should favor posix or gnu extensions?,0
4457,OrtuJIRA_test_7,can we apply the jarjar solution only to commons-csv?,0
4458,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I tested this again on Ubuntu 10.04 This works with the new Tomcat instance and then when I tried the 2nd time it is not working.,0
4459,OrtuJIRA_test_7,But when i delete the file which was created at <tomcat-home>/bin/search-index/write.lock  it works fine  but I'm not sure whether this creates other implications?,0
4460,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Further I think the tags are not saved any ware because after redeploying I found the tags I added are missing.,0
4461,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Is this due to the deletion of write.lock,0
4462,OrtuJIRA_test_7,From the logs it is clear that the reducers could not fetch the output for map attempt attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036.,0
4463,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Both the reducers (and possibly everybody else) is waiting on these.,0
4464,OrtuJIRA_test_7,There is something mysterious going on here.,0
4465,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If attempt id 1 was speculative the framework would not have killed it as the original attempt was a failure.,0
4466,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If it was not was the attempt Id 1 killed explicitly?,0
4467,OrtuJIRA_test_7,In any case why did not the framework try and re execute this map somewhere else?,0
4468,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Could you let us know if speculative execution was turned on?,0
4469,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If by any chance you have the logs for the task attempts attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036_0 and attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036_1 could you attach them to this Jira?,0
4470,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Attaching the 10 findbugs reports for common and the various hadoop-tools projects and hadoop-auth.,0
4471,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Common has 100 or so warnings and there's a couple dozen spread out around the others.,0
4472,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Probably makes sense to do these like HDFS-4014 sensitive changes get their own patch and the general new classes of warning can be handled in bulk in a small set of patches.,0

4485,OrtuJIRA_test_7,created: 2005-09-18 23:36:49.000 resolved: 2007-06-04 10:08:18.657 updated: 2011-05-10 16:51:30.000,0
4486,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183 more or less).,0
4487,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Am I missing the connection or is this a distinct issue?,0
4488,OrtuJIRA_test_7,File formats are forever.,0
4489,OrtuJIRA_test_7,More variations add significant long-term compatibility burdens to the project.,0
4490,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable.,0
4491,OrtuJIRA_test_7,But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.,0
4492,OrtuJIRA_test_7,So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.,0
4493,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.,0
4494,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.,0
4495,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile.,0
4496,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive language-independent serialization system and container file.,0
4497,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation.,0
4498,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.,0
4499,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.,0
4500,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.,0
4501,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.,0
4502,OrtuJIRA_test_7,They cannot afford to do it frequently.,0
4503,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use less fragile and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools.,0
4504,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Fixed TestCompositeService to not depend on test-order and thus made it pass on JDK7.,0

4506,OrtuJIRA_test_7,@Andy I have some thing which is similar to this and sorry if am diverting the current JIRA title.,0
4507,OrtuJIRA_test_7,May be i have the current PUT with me and from which i form the new PUTs to be added thro coprocessor hooks to a new region.,0
4508,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Assume the PUT(and related things) that i created in preBatchPut is also needed while i use the preWALWrite is there any way i can carry it in one flow?,0
4509,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hi,0
4510,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hope am not missing anything?,0
4511,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If you feel this can be done may be we can file an Improvement JIRA.,0
4512,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Please provide your suggestions,0
4513,OrtuJIRA_test_7,How about renaming leftResults as remainingResults ?,0
4514,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Please prepare patch for trunk.,0
4515,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thanks,0
4516,OrtuJIRA_test_7,How about fixing WHIRR-337 before?,0
4517,OrtuJIRA_test_7,It should simplify things.,0
4518,OrtuJIRA_test_7,+1 in my mind the -ROOT- table is very important of routing the right RegionServer of .META.,0
4519,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The whole system could be out-of-service in case the Region of SequenceFile of the -ROOT- can NOT be opened.,0
4520,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Thus i quite agree that we put the .META.,0
4521,OrtuJIRA_test_7,directly into Zookeeper to reduce this.,0
4522,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We can avoid one case of failure.,0
4523,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Note: the attached patch does not break the existing API,0
4524,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Executing /stop on a running EC2 instance will terminate the instance.,0
4525,OrtuJIRA_test_7,There is a JIRA logged to request that 'stop' and 'terminate' be two different available actions ... see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DTACLOUD-100 - also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DTACLOUD-111,0

4530,OrtuJIRA_test_7,What would you think of just exposing incRef() & decRef() as expert public methods?,0
4531,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hi,0
4532,OrtuJIRA_test_7,We would just add ensureOpen() to those methods and make them public.,0
4533,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I don't agree to including the javadoc sources in the release.,0
4534,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The zip is already large and contains all code.,0
4535,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Using maven you can easily generate the docs yourself.,0
4536,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Or even better: use the maven repository to automatically attach the sources-jar to your eclipse/idea/netbeans project.,0
4537,OrtuJIRA_test_7,You can also download them by hand and attach them manually.,0
4538,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The comparison with 1.2.6 is not valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project..,0
4539,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I send you a simple eclipse CXF webservice project using spring and a simple eclipse CXF client project.,0
4540,OrtuJIRA_test_7,With this client project i can't get connect with the webservice published in a Apache-tomcat-5.5.25.,0
4541,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The curious thing is that with a c#.net client i can connect with that webservice but not with a java generated client.,0
4542,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I don't know what i'm doing wrong!,0
4543,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Any help would be appreciated.,0
4544,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The client stubs were generated with wsdl2java command of CXF distribution.,0

4548,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If it's never ok to pass null for the path (ie a bug in the code) then you can assert path != null or throw an AssertionError.,0
4549,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If it's OK sometimes and not others than IllegalArgumentException seems appropriate seems like it should never be legitimate to create a FileStatus w/o a path unless using the no argument constructor.,0

4563,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Hadrian I wonder if we can add a _warning_ to the 2.0 release notes about the missing hash and sign files.,0

4618,OrtuJIRA_test_7,It only breaks if j14lib is not set.,0
4619,OrtuJIRA_test_7,The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10.,0
4620,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported although we removed support for it after 10.8) and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set and the test ran just fine on 1.4.,0
4621,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4.,0

4669,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Unable to reproduce issue.,-1
4670,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Oh ok.,-1
4671,OrtuJIRA_test_7,And it will break ugly everything seems to work but data is never streamed to cassandra.,-1
4672,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry this affects 0.9.3 version too.,-1
4673,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Phabricator is being a little buggy.,-1
4674,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Tests no longer sleep,-1
4675,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry this should be YARN JIRA - filed YARN-350 instead,-1
4676,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry if this spam's things however it's unlikely that I'll work on these.,-1
4677,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Forgot about these sorry.,-1
4678,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Maurice I don't have such option or maybe I don't know where it is.,-1

4686,OrtuJIRA_test_7,yup sorry just fixed.,-1
4687,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).,-1

4689,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry about the confusion before,-1
4690,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry.,-1
4691,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues.,-1
4692,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry didn't look at the code until commit...  Can you test making it hash to a Long or a 8-byte ByteBuffer?,-1
4693,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Sorry - the above comes across as terse.,-1
4694,OrtuJIRA_test_7,I really don't know how to solve this problem.,-1

4798,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thank you for the patch Sergey.,1
4799,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I love a solution that's simpler and easier to understand than the original.,1
4800,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Henry Thanks for checking it out.,1
4801,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In fact if you happen to know why ObserverHammerQuorumTest is failing with this latest patch I'd love to hear.,1
4802,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks Jing!,1
4803,OrtuJIRA_test_8,That sounds like a plan. I love peer-reviews... :-),1
4804,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks for the very clear explanation of the needed change Dag.,1

4806,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks JinJie!,1
4807,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks Brock!,1
4808,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks Thomas!,1
4809,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks Divesh  Your patch is commited at revision: 762863,1
4810,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Sagara  Thank you very much for looking into this.,1
4811,OrtuJIRA_test_8,A pleasure :>.,1
4812,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch that broke the build on 10.9 was also backported to 10.8.,0
4813,OrtuJIRA_test_8,However on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4 so that's not a problem.,0
4814,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Here are the results of testing the latest attachment    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12605661/MAPREDUCE-5538.6.patch   against trunk revision .,0
4815,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch does not contain any @author tags.,0
4816,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I still can't work out how to do this.,0
4817,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Igor suggested moving the call to Component#onBeforeRenderChildren() inside Component#onBeforeRender() but if I do that I get an NPE in the ListView#renderItem() method even for basic code.,0
4818,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"Hmm the suggested patch is not good for DRLVM which handles ""-version"" normally.",0
4819,OrtuJIRA_test_8,What is the point to print only launcher version after all?,0
4820,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release.,0
4821,OrtuJIRA_test_8,There have been no new ones added for 2.3.,0
4822,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So when 2.3 is released you shouldn't get the problems you've had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files.,0
4823,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Committed patch with workaround in revisions 1054027 and 1054030,0
4824,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I attached our resolvers sadly we have no file system resolvers because our repository is hosted on a central server.,0
4825,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Only the cache is a local filesystem resolver.,0
4826,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"We are using this pattern ""${ivy.dir.pattern}/[revision]/[artifact].",0
4827,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"[ext]"" so we should fullfil the requirements for the atomic operation.",0
4828,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Is it planned to add the atomic feature to all resolvers?,0
4829,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I did some more messing around and I was wrong about the FS stuff.,0
4830,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I deleted the local hbase directory and the problem went away.,0
4831,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Does this mean the migrate tool is busted for this version?,0
4832,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Problem ensuing from source files inconsistency,0
4833,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch with the fixes.,0
4834,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Committing shortly.,0
4835,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Applying both patches results in clean tests (jdbc4 tests and derbyall modulo wisconsin noise).,0
4836,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Yeah that one (TestAtomicOperation) has me worried a bit.,0
4837,OrtuJIRA_test_8,That one has not failed in a *very* long.,0
4838,OrtuJIRA_test_8,And new we've had two failures within a few days.,0
4839,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch integrated to trunk.,0
4840,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Closed after release.,0
4841,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Doc update to correct FQCN.,0
4842,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Simon I'm going to get deletes working tests passing using maps in the RT branch then we can integrate.,0
4843,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This'll probably be best.,0
4844,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"Jason I suggest you create a separate issue something like ""Integrate BytesRefHash in Realtime Branch"" and I will take care of it.",0
4845,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I think this issue had a clear target to factor out the hash table out of TermsHashPerField and we should close it.,0
4846,OrtuJIRA_test_8,lets use a new one to track the integration.,0
4847,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Now I can see this from the traces too.,0
4848,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We are re-using the prepared statement after table t1 is dropped.,0
4849,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Completed: At revision: 520469,0
4850,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I believe this will be done only when the package name has to be changed due to backward incompatibilities.,0
4851,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This is not new : we have the same type of behaviour when we switch languages...,0
4852,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Note: also change the use/effect of network connector dynamicOnly  - this flag had little effect but is now re-commissioned to indicate whether durable subs should be auto bridged (default) or whether they should be dynamic only.,0
4853,OrtuJIRA_test_8,There is no change to the default behavior.,0
4854,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Fixed long ago.,0
4855,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Deleting an entry now flushes the main page cache.,0
4856,OrtuJIRA_test_8,the link you point to is not our official javadoc  our official javadoc is in the maven repo.,0
4857,OrtuJIRA_test_8,if you want to view online there is a refreshed version here: wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc  for fragment see here  http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc/org/apache/wicket/markup/html/panel/Fragment.html,0
4858,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I would like to get some early comments on the changes I have made to the Namenode to support restarting within the same JVM.,0
4859,OrtuJIRA_test_8,There are still some debugging prints that will go away in the final submission.,0
4860,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Oops you're right that makes sense.,0
4861,OrtuJIRA_test_8,New patch that includes those changes.,0
4862,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In the future I could just get around the issue by using relative symlinks for those files (I think).,0
4863,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch does not contain any @author tags.,0
4864,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.,0
4865,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.,0
4866,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.,0
4867,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.,0
4868,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.,0
4869,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.,0
4870,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.,0
4871,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The mvn site goal succeeds with this patch.,0
4872,OrtuJIRA_test_8,{color:green}+1 core tests{color}.,0
4873,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch passed unit tests in .,0
4874,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Fxied and regression test written,0
4875,OrtuJIRA_test_8,These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument.,0
4876,OrtuJIRA_test_8,It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler.,0
4877,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Has anyone opened an issue at http://bugs.sun.com yet?,0
4878,OrtuJIRA_test_8,That method which inverts a single document was replaced with new code starting with 2.3 so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4.,0
4879,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But it'd still be nice to get the actual hotspot bug fixed.,0
4880,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"How about following the naming from Math.min() and Math.max(): public static Date min(Date date1 Date date2) public static Date max(Date date1 Date date2)  Alternatively when I read 'Returnes [sic] the least recent (oldest)"" why not call the methods oldest() and newest()",0
4881,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved search fields on root context and parameters map.,0
4882,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Yes but even for Java 5 a relative path to a directory with flattened dependencies would be shorter wouldn't it?,0
4883,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Committed to 0.92 and trunk.,0
4884,OrtuJIRA_test_8,And compatibility test also ....,0
4885,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Murray that is exactly what I am proposing - having a separate org.apache.jspwiki.api -package and placing a number of existing manager classes into it as interfaces.,0
4886,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Or to be precise a mostly equivalent set of APIs JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext which the old API signatures do not mostly support.,0
4887,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I would also like us to start using WikiNames wherever useful.,0
4888,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.,0
4889,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.,0
4890,OrtuJIRA_test_8,if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.,0
4891,OrtuJIRA_test_8,If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.,0
4892,OrtuJIRA_test_8,* he knows that the classes are potentially unstable.,0
4893,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In addition it makes the committer's life easier since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties.,0
4894,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We have so many people contributing in the code that API incompatibilities can creep in without anyone noticing.,0
4895,OrtuJIRA_test_8,(There is no PageManager at all there is a ContentManager which will have a very similar API but it will manage both pages and attachments.,0
4896,OrtuJIRA_test_8,What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase Kristian?,0
4897,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Julien please have a look on ./test/cpp/TestServer.cpp It's doing exactly what you what to do but TFramedTransport is explicitly specified there.,0
4898,OrtuJIRA_test_8,It looks like HLog main has support to invoke --split.,0
4899,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Does it looks like if I call that on the log that it will put split it and put the data into the right place?,0
4900,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We had a handful of regionservers go OOM yesterday while a MR job was doing heavy writes to a column family that doesn't usually get them.,0
4901,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In this case the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum.,0
4902,OrtuJIRA_test_8,How about patch 2?,0
4903,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"I added a "".""",0
4904,OrtuJIRA_test_8,to the end of the message.,0
4905,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes.,0
4906,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Senaka  That is exactly what I'd like to do i.e. automatic download of CA cert and go ahead.,0
4907,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Is this possible?,0
4908,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Frank,0
4909,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Please have a look at the latest patch FELIX-3339_threaddump-as-inventoryprinter_FIXED.patch which correctly provides an InventoryPrinter implementation of Thread Dumper have a look at the attached Screen Shot 2013-05-23 at 3.02.24 PM.pdf to see it in action embedded in the WebConsole.,0
4910,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I hope you'll like it!,0
4911,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The patch looks good and the tests pass +1.,0
4912,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I agree there's a bug I just want to ensure any change still works correctly when CURRENT_USER name is passed in.,0
4913,OrtuJIRA_test_8,My assertion is that the username passed into these routines (without any modification) is equivalent to value of an username identifier in the SQL language after it has been parsed by the SQL engine.,0
4914,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"This is also known as ""how it is stored in the SQL engine"" [JDBC].",0
4915,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Note that though how users names are represented in the derby.,0
4916,OrtuJIRA_test_8,* properties may or may not match how a SQL engine would store them.,0
4917,OrtuJIRA_test_8,For historical reasons in some (all?),0
4918,OrtuJIRA_test_8,cases the values in a derby.,0
4919,OrtuJIRA_test_8,* property may be as a delimited identifier e.g.,0
4920,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"""eVe"".",0
4921,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Note that the Derby builtin users are not created through a SQL identifier in the SQL language e.g.,0
4922,OrtuJIRA_test_8,in a CREATE USER statement.,0
4923,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"They are created by setting properties and are thus not ""stored in the SQL engine"".",0
4924,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Does not appear to exist in trunk.,0
4925,OrtuJIRA_test_8,These blockers and critical issues are resolved but not verified.,0
4926,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Reporters of these issues please verify the fixes and help close these issues,0
4927,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I couldn't reproduce this.,0
4928,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Ted can you reproduce this outside of cassidy.pl?,0
4929,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks for the response.,0
4930,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go rather than through chaining which makes it a lot harder to see what is required.,0
4931,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code.,0
4932,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Regarding Doug's points...  > But perhaps the preferred import should instead be 'import static SchemaBuilder.*'?,0
4933,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well.,0
4934,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Sounds good.,0
4935,OrtuJIRA_test_8,> We can convert from Java object to JsonNode by parsing the output of GenericData.toString(Object).,0
4936,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks.,0
4937,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I've updated the patch to do this but it still needs tests for this part.,0
4938,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I'm thinking of multiple concurrent mutateRows operation trying to lock the same set of rows.,0
4939,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Perhaps throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock.,0
4940,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But we still might want to sort it to ensure (better) progress (no livelock).,0
4941,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Unless I'm missing something your patch doesn't actually change how the version is checked only how it's computed.,0
4942,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Did you intend to combine our patches or is your patch incomplete?,0
4943,OrtuJIRA_test_8,[bulk update] Close all resolved issues that haven't been updated for more than one year.,0
4944,OrtuJIRA_test_8,- push out to 0.5,0
4945,OrtuJIRA_test_8,A workaround for this issue is to use entity resolver.,0
4946,OrtuJIRA_test_8,You may close this issue.,0
4947,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Also when do you plan to take up AMBARI-1843 for adding the unit tests?,0
4948,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We do not have to block this jira on the unit tests but we should probably try and get that in sooner than later.,0
4949,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Added patch to support configuration mapping,0
4950,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Wonky.,0
4951,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"Although as far as I see it the bug here is that we allow the underscore after ""_design/"" not that we can't use filters from it.",0
4952,OrtuJIRA_test_8,To me this is intersection.,0
4953,OrtuJIRA_test_8,See the below example  Employee1 Employee2 Employee3  Dept1.employess=Employee1 Dept1.employess=Employee3  Dept2.employess=Employee2  Intersection   Employee1 x Dept1.employess=Employee1 Employee3 x Dept1.employess=Employee3 Employee2 x Dept2.employess=Employee2  I don't like this sintax since it changes an obvious behaviour IMO.,0
4954,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I would prefer to write it as  SELECT intersect(employeethis.employees).manager.lastname FROM org.apache.jdo.tck.pc.company.Department VARIABLES Employee employee   Now it's up to up to clearify,0
4955,OrtuJIRA_test_8,JUnit test and Patch provided,0
4956,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch framework src/java and src/test to include JNDI adapters and unit tests.,0
4957,OrtuJIRA_test_8,> we have to do it for each call.,0
4958,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I meant for each newly added/deleted ones.,0
4959,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.,0
4960,OrtuJIRA_test_8,2) To get secure behavior for java routines the customer has to explicitly opt-in.,0
4961,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Let's be vague about what that entails right now.,0
4962,OrtuJIRA_test_8,3) If you do opt-in then you get the SQL standard behavior:     3a) Jar ids are mandatory.,0
4963,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.,0
4964,OrtuJIRA_test_8,3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.,0
4965,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.,0
4966,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Then we defer to the system class loader.,0
4967,OrtuJIRA_test_8,3d) At runtime when we invoke the routine we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file.,0
4968,OrtuJIRA_test_8,MR's fix (similar to HDFS one).,0
4969,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Note also that an implementation goal is to not spawn threads to do writes to the underlying transport (like TFileTransport does now).,0
4970,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Sample implementation of CREATE DATABASE and DROP DATABASE for MySQL 5.0.2+.,0
4971,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks.,0
4972,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all).,0
4973,OrtuJIRA_test_8,They will save RAM to a certain extent for certain situations.,0
4974,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But not very helpful at the sizes you are working with (and not settings I would use to save RAM anyway unless the amount I need to save was pretty small).,0
4975,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Also the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns which are search side.,0
4976,OrtuJIRA_test_8,My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now) but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%).,0
4977,OrtuJIRA_test_8,None of the other caches have gone up much either.,0
4978,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We have no cache evictions at all but a 99% hit ratio.,0
4979,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The sizes may be higher than you need then.,0
4980,OrtuJIRA_test_8,They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.,0
4981,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM.,0
4982,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??,0
4983,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I'd like to get them cleaned up because there are now so many that other more important and/or meaningful warnings are likely to be ignored.,0
4984,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Here's what got renamed:   .../{hadoop-hbase.postinst => hadoop.postinst}   .../deb/hbase/{hadoop-hbase-doc.dirs => hbase-doc.dirs} .../deb/hbase/{hadoop-hbase-doc.install => hbase-doc.install}  .../deb/hbase/{hadoop-hbase.dirs => hbase.dirs}      .../hbase/{hadoop-hbase.install => hbase.install}    .../{hadoop-hbase.manpages => hbase.manpages}        .../hbase/{hadoop-hbase.preinst => hbase.preinst}    .../hbase/SOURCES/{hadoop-hbase.sh => hbase.sh}      .../{hadoop-hbase.sh.suse => hbase.sh.suse},0
4985,OrtuJIRA_test_8,HADOOP-5679 changed this function to return int instead of void.,0
4986,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Some amount of searching later...,0
4987,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I can't come up with a pure-CSS in-place change for this.,0
4988,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Another alternative might be to make a little icon + onhover that displays the non-comma'ed value and change the default display to comma'ed?,0
4989,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The icon may be unnecessary maybe just onhover on the text itself?,0
4990,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Commited a fix for this into trunk using revision 610846.,0
4991,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I will work on merging this into 10.3 codeline and writing a test case.,0
4992,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The tests ran fine on my Windows XP machine with Sun jdk1.4 The commit comments are as follows  DERBY-3302 The user was running into null pointer exception at the time of database recovery because Derby was trying to get the Collator object through database context.,0
4993,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But the  Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and we do not have to go to database context to get it.,0
4994,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I changed the code to use that collator  object rather than look into database context.,0
4995,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The reason for null pointer exception was  that database context was not loaded yet during database recovery.,0
4996,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I would like to close this issue.,0
4997,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Redirect handling has undergone significant changes since this issue was opened and we still need to take a hard look at redirects and possibly how scores are represented.,0
4998,OrtuJIRA_test_8,However the newer scoring and indexing frameworks do work around this issue.,0
4999,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Pushed to master.,0
5000,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I have changed the title and description of this JIRA to fit our current idea.,0
5001,OrtuJIRA_test_8,A slow hash algorithm makes offline cracking harder.,0
5002,OrtuJIRA_test_8,It would require changes to the API to have crypto only run on the server but it might be simpler.,0
5003,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Fixed the crash in this bug let's open a new one for the SPDY connection issues.,0
5004,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Could you attach a test case (Junit preferrably) that shows the unexpected behaviour?,0
5005,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This may only be related to the BlurIndexReader and may not be an issue in the BlurIndexNRT.,0
5006,OrtuJIRA_test_8,marking Fixed in 1.3  (I believe Ryan left this open to track any potential issues ...  if nothing else this way we'll remember to resolve it before releasing),0
5007,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"I was thinking more of what happens on a Unix shell when you hit ""clear"".",0
5008,OrtuJIRA_test_8,With your patch the cursor might still be at the end of the grunt window after 14 new lines.,0
5009,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Claus I think I'm busy the next two weeks with [CAMEL-3468|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3468] [CAMEL-3472|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3472] [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471] [CAMEL-3470|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3470] and [CAMEL-3311|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3311].,0
5010,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Depending of the release date for Camel 2.6 and the priority of the other issues (may be I can reschedule [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471] and/or other issues) I can do it in the remaining time.,0
5011,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Adds a new class of Exception.,0
5012,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Now TestBatchUpdate takes 50 sec instead of 250.,0
5013,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Please review.,0
5014,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Obviously I was testing artifacts:sources as well.,0
5015,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"buildr idea still produces the ""old"" format files (IDEA 6 maybe?)",0
5016,OrtuJIRA_test_8,At some moments it could be upgraded to do IDEA 8 format but it's not important for now.,0
5017,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?,0
5018,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokens into smaller ones and recalculate offsets right?,0
5019,OrtuJIRA_test_8,For example: EdgeNGramTokenFilter ThaiWordFilter SmartChineseAnalyzer's WordTokenFilter etc?,0
5020,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok.  Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?,0
5021,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This seems to be what is causing the problem.,0
5022,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Uploading another patch for fixing the maven pattern to add the classifier.,0
5023,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I don't see the connection to .tmp files.,0
5024,OrtuJIRA_test_8,(Also: have you verified that the channel will actually infinite-loop returning 0?,0
5025,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Kind of odd behavior although I guess it's technically within-spec.),0
5026,OrtuJIRA_test_8,IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').,0
5027,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.,0
5028,OrtuJIRA_test_8,What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes.,0
5029,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so I think answered your second question so it wasn't very clear).,0
5030,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Note that without this patch there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu though very few probably in that case).,0
5031,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files.,0
5032,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But it does as a consequence of correctly raising an exception when should be.,0

5060,OrtuJIRA_test_8,To answer your questions in order: This problem only happens with the embedded driver because the Database is created inside the JVM and locked to prevent other processes to connect to it.,0
5061,OrtuJIRA_test_8,With the client you can connect to the same database many times.,0

5067,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Regards  Leon,0
5068,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hey Uma I've elected not to revert the patch as-committed since it does indeed fix the bug at hand.,0
5069,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But in reviewing the patch I've come up with a number of ideas for how LeaseManager#changeLease and FSNamesystem#unprotectedChangeLease can be improved.,0
5070,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I've filed them in this JIRA: HDFS-2875.,0
5071,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Will try and do so within the next couple of days unless [~bikassaha] or [~sseth] beat me to it.,0
5072,OrtuJIRA_test_8,As KeywordTokenizer does the same thing I'll close this issue.,0
5073,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Some folks on the mailing list had something like this happening to them.,0
5074,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Added Maven Remote Resources Plugin version 1.0-alpha-5.,0
5075,OrtuJIRA_test_8,My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.,0
5076,OrtuJIRA_test_8,(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.),0
5077,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.,0
5078,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In general one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.,0
5079,OrtuJIRA_test_8,An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.,0
5080,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical.,0
5081,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So back to your statement a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.,0
5082,OrtuJIRA_test_8,It does incur extra system calls but uses less memory which is a tradeoff.,0
5083,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Is that what you meant?,0
5084,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I will upload another patch (V5) in a couple minutes.,0
5085,OrtuJIRA_test_8,There are some changes about ServerName in the past few weeks so v5.patch changed this one-line {code}       return ServerName.valueOf(hostname 1234 1L) {code},0

5130,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch that adds the fix to WebResponse,0
5131,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks for patch v2.,0
5132,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Some comments: 20.,0
5133,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Log.truncateTo(): The following code seems to be used just for getting the first segment.,0
5134,OrtuJIRA_test_8,22,0
5135,OrtuJIRA_test_8,ReplicaManager: 22.1 recordLeaderLogUpdate(): Could we rename it to recordLeaderLogEndOffset()?,0
5136,OrtuJIRA_test_8,22.2 close(): Could we rename it to shutdown to map startup()?,0
5137,OrtuJIRA_test_8,22.3 readCheckpointedHighWatermark(): We should just read the HW from memory.,0
5138,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The on-disk version is only useful on broker startup when we populate the in-memory HW using the on disk version.,0
5139,OrtuJIRA_test_8,23,0
5140,OrtuJIRA_test_8,"HighwaterMarkCheckpoint: Is it better to name the file "".highwaterMark"" so that it's hidden?",0
5141,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I applied the patch at revision: 599008.,0
5142,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Still why do we hardcode these numbers e.g.,0
5143,OrtuJIRA_test_8,port/src/lil/em64t/pim/m2n_em64t_internal.h: #ifdef _WIN64 const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 120 #else const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 104 #endif  vmcore/src/util/em64t/base/compile_em64t.cpp: // Stack size should be (% 8 == 0) but shouldn't be (% 16 == 0) const int ALIGNMENT = 0  Doesn't it worth to let compiler calculate such values?,0
5144,OrtuJIRA_test_8,It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.,0
5145,OrtuJIRA_test_8,http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp03216.html  {noformat} OutputStream out = fs.open(...) try {   out.write(...) } finally {   out.close() } {noformat}  When multiple files are involved the best thing is to nest the try blocks.,0
5146,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS?,0
5147,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This looks good but I wish there was a good way to set up a test case.,0
5148,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I guess the best way would be to create a JobTracker and call the heartbeat method and observe the requested heartbeat interval.,0
5149,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I included the gen stamp and length in the {{cacheReport}} to handle caching newly appended data.,0
5150,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.,0
5151,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Alternatively I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data but there are quota implications there.,0
5152,OrtuJIRA_test_8,On startup I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated.,0
5153,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I also agree that jittering doesn't matter as much if it's ticking on such a short time scale.,0
5154,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked.,0
5155,OrtuJIRA_test_8,However since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports let's just ape how block reports work don't jitter the incremental reports but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval.,0
5156,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092) if this sounds good I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items.,0
5157,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Uploaded a patch that fixes the comments and includes the test,0
5158,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thanks for the review.,0
5159,OrtuJIRA_test_8,We used to do 'stopping'.,0
5160,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Smile.,0
5161,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Stopping' gets us closer to classic Lifecycle.,0
5162,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I think just needed for this at mo.,0
5163,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Because this neither-here-nor-there code-reuse seems not much useful.,0
5164,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS.,0
5165,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But it seems like clients have to know which protocol they are talking to.,0
5166,OrtuJIRA_test_8,fully agree Christian!,0
5167,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I refereed to the [^v1-enable-wall-werror.patch] which contains {{-Wall -Werror}} and I thought it sould be {{-Wall -Wextra}}  However just add {{-Wall}}  to that patch makes absolutely sense and could be committed.,0
5168,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Nicholas did you solve the issue?,0
5169,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Thank you for the patch Shawn can you also tell us what behavior you are seeing that is wrong?,0
5170,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Maybe you can paste a SOAP query example request and explain the wrong behavior and what it is you are expecting?,0
5171,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Commit cf6045f1aa37674f0225144ae0a1f662f955f153 in branch refs/heads/pvlan from [~jessicawang] [ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cloudstack.gith=cf6045f ]  CLOUDSTACK-747: internalLb in VPC - UI - create network offering - system offering dropdown is for router only.,0
5172,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Change its variable name to be more intuitive.,0
5173,OrtuJIRA_test_8,you need to create system offering for system vms (ssvmcpvmrouter vm) and then you can upgrade to new system offerings it is only supported in vmware,0
5174,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Marking as dup of HBASE-5861 (You saw it first Andrew but Jon is going to work on this over in 5861..),0
5175,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch applied Thank to Clay Leeds.,0
5176,OrtuJIRA_test_8,(BTW - The Idea to retrieve the Document Title is the best solution on my opinion.),0
5177,OrtuJIRA_test_8,[~smarthi] When I apply this patch the source code cannot be compiled.,0
5178,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Another error is that the class Functions.NEGATE is misspelled as Function.NEGATE.,0
5179,OrtuJIRA_test_8,If you have the opportunity to do it go ahead.,0
5180,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Now again in the next trip of finalization it will throw NodeExistsException here it is really required to do the #store.,0
5181,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Patch looks good to me.,0
5182,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I'm fine w/ not naming it Consumer - I agree it does not really consume it.,0
5183,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But if we go with PayloadMergeProcessor we'll need PayloadMergeProcessorProvider and they become quite long names :).,0
5184,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I was thinking PayloadProcessor and PayloadProcessorProvider (have cool acronyms to PP and PPP) but then people might get confused that it processes all payloads (maybe before they are even written the first time) while it is actually invoked only during segment merges.I was following the *Consumer pattern I saw all over the place w/ SegmentMerger and thought that if someone ever reads SM code it will swallow easily another *Consumer one ...,0
5185,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So between PC PMP and PP - I prefer PP - the documentation should clarify what it does.,0
5186,OrtuJIRA_test_8,But I'm open for suggestions.,0
5187,OrtuJIRA_test_8,setting    set hive.script.auto.progress=true  seems to have no effect.,0
5188,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Abhinav can you also attach cloud_usage db dump.,0
5189,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Need it to test the fix.,0
5190,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I changed the ubuntu version too.,0
5191,OrtuJIRA_test_8,By the way getCanonicalPath() performs actual file access may take long if drive is slow (e. g. Samba) may fail with exception if path is inaccessible at the moment (e. g. on network drive) etc.,0
5192,OrtuJIRA_test_8,On the other hand getAbsolutePath() is purely logical and doesn't need file system access.,0
5193,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created).,0
5194,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Only the first of these is a failure.,0
5195,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails.,0
5196,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?,0
5197,OrtuJIRA_test_8,There were most definitely 21 test case failures.,0
5198,OrtuJIRA_test_8,<danielsh> Yes any23.zones.apache.org is the jail's hostname so use the IP it resolves to.,0
5199,OrtuJIRA_test_8,ill upload a patch for 3.1 and 3.2 branch as soon as ZOOKEEPER-597 gets committed to those branches.,0
5200,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Yeah seems safe.,0
5201,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Will commit a bit later unless somebody beats me to it.,0
5202,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Hi Zeid  I'll go ahead and commit your changes but this one doesn't look right...I think it's a hold over  from the Mac files.,0
5203,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This symbol is not used for the Windows Netaccessor.,0

5205,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Please watch the source tree over the next several weeks before our next release.,0

5378,OrtuJIRA_test_9,great idea those are lost to the ages but I'll try to reproduce.,1
5379,OrtuJIRA_test_9,However the goal of the test was very good.,1
5380,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Pat.,1
5381,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Patch looks good to me.,1
5382,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I like this title.,1
5383,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks.,1
5384,OrtuJIRA_test_9,indeed good catch!,1
5385,OrtuJIRA_test_9,That's a good point we should make sure that it doesn't decrease performance for one of the database types even if it increases it for Oracle (in which case making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too).,1
5386,OrtuJIRA_test_9,(@ddlatham: thats kinda funny that you wrote the linked-to article -- it was a random google search),1
5387,OrtuJIRA_test_9,This is the bridge code minus the redundant bit.,0
5388,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I would like that add that the problem is highly reproducible.,0
5389,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Looks great to me.,0
5390,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Doug.,0
5391,OrtuJIRA_test_9,These file describes my change:  derby1434-try2.diff (attached multiple times should have the same content) derby1434-try2.stat,0
5392,OrtuJIRA_test_9,And it's somehow connected to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-137,0
5393,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"The reason of such big number of ""ByteArrayOutputStream.write"" invokes is signed ext/bcprov.jar - it's manifest is read by byte.",0
5394,OrtuJIRA_test_9,If we put this jar to bootclasspath we'll have at least 5% performance boost on HWA application .,0
5395,OrtuJIRA_test_9,btw: maybe we should add this Jira's as subtasks to HARMONY-5277 ?,0
5396,OrtuJIRA_test_9,As they're startup related.,0
5397,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Ok all done  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KATO  I found sgoyal jira username to be shubham so hope thats right if so good to go!,0
5398,OrtuJIRA_test_9,comments on phabricator,0
5399,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I guessed UIMA_HOME/config but could be /lib,0
5400,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler the rest is just configuration loading on start up you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction and see what is going on.,0
5401,OrtuJIRA_test_9,So either new-style hints are being written without versionColumn by RowMutation.hintFor or old style hints did not get cleaned out properly by SystemTable.purgeIncompatibleHints.,0
5402,OrtuJIRA_test_9,But both of those look fine to me.,0
5403,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Hi  I have changed the rsync to rsync.eu.apache.org.,0
5404,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Please check it now.,0
5405,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Regards Softaculous Team,0
5406,OrtuJIRA_test_9,> Stage 2 btw will involve documentation.,0
5407,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I'm not forgetting it :)   Did you forget it or did I miss it somewhere?,0
5408,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Is it possible to do this when closing the input/outputstream aswell?,0
5409,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Mathias.,0
5410,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Bringing into 0.90.0.,0
5411,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Marking as critical.,0
5412,OrtuJIRA_test_9,@Jon Thanks for committing it.,0
5413,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Anoop reminded me about this.,0
5414,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.,0
5415,OrtuJIRA_test_9,It is not well documented in MSDN but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes.,0
5416,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Some functions don't require it but some do.,0
5417,OrtuJIRA_test_9,A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code so if a native method has an odd number of arguments additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes.,0
5418,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Patch applied at 514264.,0
5419,OrtuJIRA_test_9,So I am likely going to work on this soon.,0
5420,OrtuJIRA_test_9,What is the exact problem?,0
5421,OrtuJIRA_test_9,If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :),0
5422,OrtuJIRA_test_9,You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code )  Also it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue.,0
5423,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed.,0
5424,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file.,0
5425,OrtuJIRA_test_9,32 bit ubuntu 12.10,0
5426,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Marking this for 0.18.4 and above since it's a deadlock.,0
5427,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions.,0
5428,OrtuJIRA_test_9,This blocker/ critcal was created before July please review and resolve we are approaching 4.2 code freeze in 7 days,0
5429,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Was fixed to behave as it used to.,0
5430,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks for the patch.,0
5431,OrtuJIRA_test_9,It works for me both in container and in testing with WicketTester.,0
5432,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"As I said on that thread I'm in a compilers class right now and I thought I might make a more ""enlightened"" attempt using lex/yacc soon and see where that gets me if no one else gets this done first.",0
5433,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"anyway if someone is brave enough to fix the ""attempt one"" script i wish them well )",0
5434,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I added a rm -rf /tmp/h* to hadoopqa... and ran this again.... seems to be working:  https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7253/console  We'll see.,0
5435,OrtuJIRA_test_9,by the way the only open impl of this algorithm i could find is at http://rrette.com/moman.html (ZSpell) in python.,0
5436,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I recently stumbled upon a C++ey STLey impl -> http://code.google.com/p/patl/  bq.,0
5437,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I might be on the trail of a java impl - get out the hounds!,0
5438,OrtuJIRA_test_9,If you do take hold of it do not hesitate to share :) The original paper and C++ code likewise melt my brain and I needed the algo in some other place.,0
5439,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Go ahead commit Nitay.,0
5440,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We can file issues with it as we find them.,0
5441,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Hi Deepa I looked at the transaction logs afaict this is not a bug rather the znode you mention is not deleted on session expiration because it was already explicitly deleted by another session.,0
5442,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I dumped the txnlog from zookeeper2 here is the section of interest.,0
5443,OrtuJIRA_test_9,afaict things are working properly at least on the ZK side of things.,0
5444,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Fixed a typo in the oritinal patch.,0
5445,OrtuJIRA_test_9,toString() method added.,0
5446,OrtuJIRA_test_9,FWIW: this issue is a regression of JCR-890 i.e.,0
5447,OrtuJIRA_test_9,the refactoring involved (r982520).,0
5448,OrtuJIRA_test_9,there might be more hidden issues like this.,0
5449,OrtuJIRA_test_9,+1 let's rip it out and redo it if we need it.,0
5450,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I wasn't talking about the perment schedule.,0
5451,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I was talking that the first three months of becoming a TLP we have to report monthly.,0
5452,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"Kevin we already have that -- the jobs are named after the file (if you run pig myfile.pig) but you can override the name with ""set job.name myname""  With this ticket that job name would essentially become a prefix.",0
5453,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I've saw this after completed the issue.,0
5454,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I've rework almost all needed messages in Preconditions.checkArgument.,0
5455,OrtuJIRA_test_9,And I did it according the style of each class.,0
5456,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I think it will be useful to standardize all the messages.,0
5457,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"Example for case: Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0 ""size must be at least 0"") we can do like Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0 ""Wrong size: "" + size + "".",0
5458,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Marking this an incompatible change so that it gets attention.,0
5459,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Also setting webinterface.private.actions has other effects like enabling the 'kill job' and 'kill task' links on the Job web UI.,0
5460,OrtuJIRA_test_9,@Joy: I agree that not losing heartbeats is the best scenario.,0
5461,OrtuJIRA_test_9,In the case I mentioned in my above comment we would not lose datanode heartbeats if we implement HDFS-1392.,0
5462,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"On the other hand if there is a true network partition then NN will ""lose heartbeats"" from datanodes because the datanodes cannot send messages to the NN.",0
5463,OrtuJIRA_test_9,In that case the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon.,0
5464,OrtuJIRA_test_9,So the heuristic that I listed above to detect a network partition should still be applicable isn't it?,0
5465,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Hi,0
5466,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Yep i am actually using just Pax Runner/Exam to start Ace stuff.. but i am not 100% sure about what the MuliFrameworkStarter is about.. what is it good for ?,0
5467,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Checked in with revision 388211.,0
5468,OrtuJIRA_test_9,After applied patch the output format just like this :  [root@infra1 bin]# ./hdfs dfs -count -header / DIR_COUNT FILE_COUNT CONTENT_SIZE FILE_NAME            7        10002           10292583 / [root@infra1 bin]# ./hdfs dfs -count -q -header / QUOTA REMAINING_QUATA SPACE_QUOTA REMAINING_SPACE_QUOTA DIR_COUNT FILE_COUNT CONTENT_SIZE FILE_NAME   2147483647      2147473638            none             inf            7        10002           10292583 /,0
5469,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The unit test code is for a sleep job where splits need not be different since they are empty.,0
5470,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"Here is his response:  ""There is no reason to change the version in the header as the version can be anything (ISO 19005-2:2005 6.1.2).",0

5474,OrtuJIRA_test_9,That seems to work for me - thanks!,0
5475,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The preliminary patch is attached.,0
5476,OrtuJIRA_test_9,David  I've done a little digging and have a question around:  OrderReadHelper.getOrderItemQuantityBd()  Firstly going back a while now this log:     http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs/trunk/components/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/order/OrderReadHelper.java?rev=4367&r1=4281&r2=4367 shows a change to the strings that seems to make the first if statement redundant?!,0
5477,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?,0
5478,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"scheduleAtFixedRate ""Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay and subsequently with the given period that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period then initialDelay + 2 * period and so on.",0
5479,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"If any execution of the task encounters an exception subsequent executions are suppressed...""  so get() shouldn't be causing a cancel but if an exception is found then we need to re-schedule it manually.",0
5480,OrtuJIRA_test_9,(If you cast the Runnable in afterExecute to ScheduledFutureTask you can get access to the scheduling info.),0
5481,OrtuJIRA_test_9,if get is causing the cancel even w/o any exceptions being involved then I guess you'll need to source dive in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor to see what is going on.,0
5482,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Here are two thread dumps:  sling6.thread_dump.01.txt was taken about 10 seconds after a shutdown of Sling was attempted.,0
5483,OrtuJIRA_test_9,sling6.thread_dump.02.txt was taken a couple minutes later.,0
5484,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I include it because quite a few of the threads from the first dump have stopped by this point.,0
5485,OrtuJIRA_test_9,thx todd missed the ant/ivy stuff update patch takes care of it (hopefully mavenized gridmix goes in soon and ant/ivy will go away),0
5486,OrtuJIRA_test_9,According to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6336 we can't use git for websites.,0
5487,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks for the reference I'll look into it.,0
5488,OrtuJIRA_test_9,[~egli] - can you reproduce?,0
5489,OrtuJIRA_test_9,If you do you'd stand a better chance of making a proper fix...,0
5490,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I don't have the cycles today.,0
5491,OrtuJIRA_test_9,It would be great if you could work on it.,0
5492,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thus assigning the issue to you.,0
5493,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks.,0
5494,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"I have uploaded the modified patch ""PartyCommunication.patch"" and it is ready for testing.",0
5495,OrtuJIRA_test_9,This is the reverse side of ARIES 399 which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe.,0
5496,OrtuJIRA_test_9,As mentioned there to fix the issues blueprint code that calls out to any kind of client code (reference listeners service listeners initialiser methods) should not hold the full BlueprintRepository lock which allows deadlocks like the two observed.,0
5497,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Or at least the locks need to be much more fine-grained than locking the whole container.,0
5498,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :),0
5499,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook kicking in at the same time.,0
5500,OrtuJIRA_test_9,i modified the test class from HADOOP-6148 (bigger is better) the result is:   ||bytes||PureJava MB/sec||Native MB/sec||Random PureJava MB/sec||Native MB/sec|| | 1,0
5501,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I fixed the build failures on 4.1 this morning.,0
5502,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I'm doing an automated test as well.,0
5503,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Will close this ticket if there are no issues.,0
5504,OrtuJIRA_test_9,FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #344 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/344/]) HDFS-5041.,0
5505,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Add the time of last heartbeat to dead server Web UI.,0
5506,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The patch should be licensed to ASF for inclusion in ASF works.,0
5507,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Is that part of the test in question?,0
5508,OrtuJIRA_test_9,lifecycle management up to a separate container  Agreed and my patch also contains a TODO for that.,0
5509,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Similar to all other plugins the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g.,0
5510,OrtuJIRA_test_9,in an OSGi container as a separate bundle.,0
5511,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Instead of hardcoding the hooks we could introduce a LifeCycleHookProvider similar to ValidatorProvider we already have.,0
5512,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Subject.doAs tricks  Good point.,0
5513,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Though we have to review that usage in general.,0
5514,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I'll try the approach you suggested.,0
5515,OrtuJIRA_test_9,api_key and secret_key are not required.,0
5516,OrtuJIRA_test_9,data sync is external to cloudstack,0
5517,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thank you Ole!,0
5518,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Committed v2 patch to trunk with revision 508383.,0
5519,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Committed to HDFS-3042 branch.,0
5520,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks for the reviews Bikas and Aaron.,0
5521,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I said above that the earlier patches were lost but nope there they are.,0
5522,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"Anyway the ""-2"" patches include all the changes in the first patch files.",0
5523,OrtuJIRA_test_9,What platform?,0
5524,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?,0
5525,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We need to make this configurable before we can apply this patch to the trunk (unless i have misunderstood the effect).,0
5526,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The demo looks like it will be very useful.,0
5527,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Cyriaque.,0
5528,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Form#maxSize is ignored now too.,0
5529,OrtuJIRA_test_9,> Another thing: is the try ... catch good or bad?,0
5530,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I guess will be better not catch since until now was not being catched and will be good to propagate upwards.,0
5531,OrtuJIRA_test_9,v2 removes some dross included by misstack.,0
5532,OrtuJIRA_test_9,You could easily test if it is due to felix by switching to equinox if the effects are still there blame it on pax web or dosgi.,0
5533,OrtuJIRA_test_9,This jira is unassigned but contains a patch that needs to be reviewed for inclusion in 1.1.1.,0
5534,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Would a new configuration boolean 'fs.manual.shutdown' be adequate for your needs?,0
5535,OrtuJIRA_test_9,You could programatically set this before getting your filesystems and when set true the shutdown hook would not be added.,0
5536,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Vinay thanks for working on this.,0
5537,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Some comments:  The new method added to Namesystem is better to # pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction # call it as isInSnapshot and # do not throw IOException.,0
5538,OrtuJIRA_test_9,{code} //Namesystem.java public boolean isInSnapshot(BlockInfoUnderConstruction block) {code} In the implementation in FSNamesystem it should try-catch the UnresolvedLinkException and log it as an error since the full path obtained from a file should not have unresolved link.,0
5539,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Second question: Why adding DFSTestUtil.abortStream(..)?,0
5540,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I appended the information to the end of the file.,0
5541,OrtuJIRA_test_9,You have the ability to add users to the mina group in svn not to the group on people.a.o.,0
5542,OrtuJIRA_test_9,To grant new users commit access check out https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization and add the appropriate usernames to the mina= line in the [groups] section of the asf-authorization file.,0

5546,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I guess it's OK to put it in trunk.,0

5592,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I reproduced the bug using Snitter.,0

5598,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Updated patch with new file.,0
5599,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Forget git add get sad...,0
5600,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The patch looks good to me.,0
5601,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Is there any particular reason on using an _ in front of the following variables?,0
5602,OrtuJIRA_test_9,{noformat} _harMetaCache {noformat}  Also this is meant for trunk only?,0
5603,OrtuJIRA_test_9,@Roger: huh this is bad as a partial integration will seg fault see BoostMonitor.cpp which does a cast of a boost::mutex.,0
5604,OrtuJIRA_test_9,It would be *highly* preferable instead to *not* include the BoostMonitor.cpp change as both are inter-dependent.,0
5605,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Alternatively I don't know what is the compiler error on Debian but it may very well be missing the include inside BoostMutex.cpp:  {code} #include <boost/thread/mutex.hpp> {code}  Thanks!,0
5606,OrtuJIRA_test_9,That's a very promising idea !,1
5607,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Will take a closer look.,0
5608,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Nice work [~stepinto] !,1
5609,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Can this ticket me marked as resolved as implementation done for portabl IP,0
5610,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Is the null check necessary?,0
5611,OrtuJIRA_test_9,the underlying protobuf handles the null properly.,0

5613,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The assert check should be made for rm1 and also for rm2.,0

5616,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Fixed by making the url absolute before passing it to the web container.,0
5617,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Looks great Todd.,0
5618,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Could we keep this DataOutputBuffer for reuse?,0
5619,OrtuJIRA_test_9,{code} +      DataOutputBuffer buf = new DataOutputBuffer(size) {code},0
5620,OrtuJIRA_test_9,If I'll come across Xerces again I'll try it.,0
5621,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Vijay.,0
5622,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"I can see why the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text ""foo"".",0
5623,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely it does come through just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(""Unknown datum type: ""+datum) error.",0
5624,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"So instead of the expected ""java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"" text being sent you get ""org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"".",0
5625,OrtuJIRA_test_9,GenericData.getSchemaName instead throws an AvroRuntimeException so the special handling of UnresolvedUnionException in Responder.respond is skipped and the nested exception text is the result.,0
5626,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Another option is to create a new type for HdfsLocatedFileStatus as {code} HdfsLocatedFileStatusProto {   HdfsFileStatusProto fs = 1   LocatedBlocksProto locations = 2 } {code},0
5627,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Anyway I am creating a project that began with 2.0.0-M3 and is now using 2.0.0-M4.,0
5628,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"that it's a huge patch is exactly why I don't want to take a ""let's just commit it and clean it up later"" approach.",0
5629,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Good idea especially if you have a use case for that.,1
5630,OrtuJIRA_test_9,You might also want to consider the induced latency though depending on the checkpoint size and frequency.,0
5631,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Make sure to use the hsync api for persistency guarantees.,0
5632,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Do you mean you checked your proposition or mine?,0
5633,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Mine is not thourougly thought it's just a suspenders AND belt solution.,0
5634,OrtuJIRA_test_9,"Also by ""working"" do you mean that you checked also for (undesired) side effects?",0
5635,OrtuJIRA_test_9,> I don't see where this is limited to user-facing pages.,0

5641,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We have done pretty intensive testing and believe this fixes the problem.,0
5642,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Here I am removing the subscription list impl and implementing it using ConcurrentLinkedQueue while keeping the interface intact as much as possible.,0
5643,OrtuJIRA_test_9,the java concurrent implementation of the queue.,0
5644,OrtuJIRA_test_9,QPID-3319.patch has the fix and QPID-3319.patch.2 and QPID-3319.patch.3 fix two other classes that cause a compilation error when the QPID-3319.path is applied.,0
5645,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Hi Carl I've made the changes JAVA_HOME and README.txt suggested by you.,0
5646,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I tested the JAVA_HOME change in Linux and it doesn't seem to work (unset JAVA_HOME and launch Eclipse for debugging).,0
5647,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Can you try it on Mac and see if it works?,0
5648,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thanks Thomas committed to 3.4.0.,0
5649,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Another interesting message from the log  258766 (http-0.0.0.0-8443-Processor2) [                Log.java:103:WARN ] Create Payment Application: Amount to apply [36.76] is greater than the outstanding amount [0.0] of the invoice [10030].,0
5650,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Creating Payment Application for outstanding amount [0.0] instead.,0
5651,OrtuJIRA_test_9,There are a few considerations to be careful about: 1) The hostname in service could be a vip name.,0
5652,OrtuJIRA_test_9,The token selector is used in ipc.Client which has InetSocketAddress of the remote server.,0
5653,OrtuJIRA_test_9,How do we make sure we are matching the right hostnames?,0
5654,OrtuJIRA_test_9,One way to address it is to get the ip address from the hostname service and use that for matching but that needs a dns lookup.,0
5655,OrtuJIRA_test_9,2) Dns lookup in token selector would be invoked for every connection using token authentication.,0
5656,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Sounds good Claudio.,1
5657,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I used to have the subset of in-memory partitions maintained as a sliding window (i.e.,0
5658,OrtuJIRA_test_9,most recently computed K partitions) but I switched to the model with K-1 partitions always in memory and 1 slot for loading out-of-core partitions because it made the logic slightly simpler.,0
5659,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We can go back to something like that if we want to manage that subset more intelligently (2).,0
5660,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I would keep the hasActive field in memory (in the PartitionStore).,0
5661,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We start with any K in-memory partitions skip on-disk partitions that have no active vertices or incoming messages and prioritize spilling partitions that have no active vertices.,0
5662,OrtuJIRA_test_9,As I explained the XSL files have nothing to do with FOP so its impossible  for FOP to tell you which file/line number in XSL stylesheet(s) the problem  lies at.,0
5663,OrtuJIRA_test_9,FOP can only tell you which line in the single FO file the error  occurred at.,0
5664,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I'll focus my efforts on the compile targets then.,0
5665,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We'll have plenty of time to go through the bundles later.,0
5666,OrtuJIRA_test_9,gora-cassandra is patched to work with this prove of concept (It's just a one-liner in CassandraStore).,0
5667,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I meant if someone eventually uses CassandraClient directly this will break.,0

5683,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Santiago and I  have removed the readExternal() writeExternal() methods (from interface Externizable) and instead rely on readObject() writeObject().,0
5684,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We still implement the Serializable interface.,0
5685,OrtuJIRA_test_9,We marked the TransformerFactoryImpl field in the TemplatesImpl class as transient to make sure it does not get serialized.,0

5695,OrtuJIRA_test_9,Thus fetchInsertIterator could be made private.,0

5698,OrtuJIRA_test_9,that we have an overridable method is not by accident We want that so that we dont keep the state in the component.,0

One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width.

I'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear, private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?",0
