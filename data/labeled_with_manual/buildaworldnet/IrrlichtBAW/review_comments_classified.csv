buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW,review_comments,327012827,358,"here's a way to do it #25 ideally you want to protect every opengl call that is likely to happen every frame (so almost all done by copengldriver) with `if (nextvalue!=currentvalue)` so that you're not pounding opengl calls pointlessly. when you want to change opengl state (current pipeline, rop params, vao, vao input buffers, etc. ), dont actually change it straight away, have a deferred change mechanism. obviously there are a few exceptions that cannot be done like this, most notably setting framebuffers and push constants (these need to be immediate, not deferred). sidenote, framebuffer change is a big call with big cost, so users will be careful not to call it recklessly. basically you want to avoid a performance penalty when user or implementation sets descriptor bindings to null, and then binds own descriptor sets. same for vao, and vao buffer bindings, etc. because what would happen, is first (probably multiple) `extglbind*(0)` calls before a bind call that actually binds an object. what you want to do, is to track some of the state (not all opengl state) that is relevant to things you're going to be deferring. so you have a current-state (last flushed) cache, and a next-state cache (values that you will set to if `flushstate` is called). then when your `setactivedescriptorset` and similar calls take place, you modify the ""next-state"" (which holds opengl values you will change to). this means that while your smart pointers to front irr api objects may change, etc. opengl will not be called until it is time. only when you call `flushstate` will you check if next opengl values are different from current opengl values and call the opengl functions if necessary, then update the current state values. **don't worry about opengl objects being deleted while having their handles on ""next-state"" thats a user error.** implement a `sauxcontext::flushstate(sauxcontext::gl_state_bits, copenglstate* optoutcurrentstate)` that will change the current state to next-state and fill out the copenglstate (already in the engine) class/struct with appropriate data (so it doesn't need to `glget` query it). expose an `idriver::flushallstate()` that will call `sauxcontext::flushstate(sauxcontext::gsb_all,nullptr)` under the hood. people won't usually have to call that, as push constants, {multi}dispatch{indirect} and {multi}draw{indirect} will do it under the hood for them. my proposal for the flags is (you should also flush/update the opengl state in the order of the flags, most costly to least) [code block] also a `sauxcontext::notifyofstate(const copenglstate& externallychangedstate)` could be useful for interop with middlewares (set the current state cache to that which is reported).",0,0,0,0.9387653470039368,0.9650360941886902,0.9746193289756776,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

[code block] now the difference is that during the override of `iscenenode::render()` the camera scene node will bind its descriptor set to slot 1, but a regular scene node will bind to slot 2. any meshbufferscenenode will take the descriptor set + dynamic offsets attached to a meshbuffer and bind it to slot 3, as well as push the constants just before the draw. and obviously `iscenemanager::drawall()` shall begin by binding descriptor set to slot 0. ## how the data will be updated we will need a `scene::descriptorsetupdater` class and a default instantiation of it that will run after `iscenenode::onanimate()` is finished, think of it like an animation call-back. i see a method like `scene::descriptorsetupdater::update(scene::iscenenode*,video::igpudescriptorset*,core::smart_refctd_dynamic_array * offsets)` the default one for cameras will stream update the buffer in location 0 at offset assigned with the matrices as expected by the `defaultperviewubo`. the default one for mesh scene nodes will do the same for `defaultperscenenodeubo`. user can derive and make a different descriptor-set-updater. i plan to replace this prototype with something much faster when i come to do #96 and bucket-rendering.",0,0,0,0.9835307002067566,0.9942930936813354,0.9941040873527528,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW,review_comments,509445110,424,"there's a far easier way to deal with the generator, it will be less divergent, less code and easier to read & understand. you should tear into the microfacet transmission generators to see how it all comes together. it's best if you intialized `out_rem` to 1.0 for non plastics and then multiplied factors onto it. ### first of all handle your reflective fresnel if your bsdf is not diffuse (diffuse or difftrans) then you will need to treat it somewhat like a blend node. the way you choose plastic vs. diffuse right now is 100% ok except for variable partition/rescale that is missing. you need an extra flag besides `out_generatorinstr` to discern which sub-generator was used. if you choose the diffuse generator, then you need to premultiply or initialize the `out_rem` to the fresnel diffuse correction factor **multiplied by `rcpchoiceprob`**, then proceed to the diffuse generator path. however for the specular generator, then you need to premultiply or initialize the `out_rem` to be the `rcpchoiceprob`, you'd then need to proceed as for a conductor, except that you **compute the fresnel like for a dielectric.** ## all non-diffuse bsdf generators generate a half vector h first so you should split your code for generating an `s` into two branches, diffuse vs. non-diffuse. ### diffuse path doesn't matter if its diff or difftrans, you need to generate a point on a hemisphere. if the material is difftrans then you use the `u.z` variable to flip the `l` direction with 50% probability pdf is trivial to compute. the microfacet cache, you should compute using our built-in function that takes an interaction and a light sample (specialized for the reflective case). ### the specular path use the correct generator to generate `h` given your ndf, it doesn't matter if the material is conductor or dielectric. if the material is smooth then simply set `h=n` (but this backend has no smooth materials, it just has ndfs with 0 roughness, so this point is moot). now for the `out_rem` compute the g2/g1 function (there might be some useful metadate that a generator overload might return). to compute the pdf you need to multiply it by ndf*g1 initially, there's one extra step in case of a dielectric material. compute the fresnel of `vdoth`, but dont use it yet. if the material cannot be refractive then set a `refraction` boolean to false. otherwise if the material could be refractive (dielectric) then choose between reflection and refraction based on the previously calculated fresnel's luma coefficients, divide the `out_rem` and multiply the pdf by the probability of your choice respectively. multiply `out_rem` by the correct frensel depending on `refraction` boolean (either `f` or `1-f`) now there's a handy function in our glsl library which can construct a microfacet cache given a view interaction, a microfacet `h` vector, a refraction boolean a few extra infos like the refractive index. use it. that's it, you're done!",0,0,0,0.7373613715171814,0.842807412147522,0.9606269001960754,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW,review_comments,376037666,410,"# was is das [a link] basically its 0 everywhere except at the center, at the center its undefined (you can return inf if argument==center). as a probability distribution it means there is 0 probability of getting any other random value than the center one, so your `sample` brdf function should always return the center coordinate with a probability weight of `max(cos(theta),0.0)` (original brdf / probability of sampling = delta/delta = 1, but then remember its `brdf_cos`). the most important part is the sampling property, you stick it as a product with another function inside any integral, the solution is the other function's value at the center of the dirac delta (without any gain or loss). this means that a mirror is a delta distribution centered around the reflected view-vector, so it basically tells you to sample the light distribution in only one place (the exact reflection). a smooth dielectric is two deltas, one at reflection vector, one at refraction vector, but they obviously have to be weighted together by the fresnel (not that it matters for the eval function). # more in depth about sampling multiple deltas however when sampling, you need to compute fresnel, and pick either to reflect or refract based on the input random value (use only one dimension). you can use the symmetry property of the bsdf and notice that it has to have the same values when you switch the observer and the light positions around, so it is possible to ""find"" the centers of the deltas given a viewer position. for a dielectric, there is the reflection where`ndoth` has to be 0, so h=n, and therefore l=-v the refraction you can also calculate in reverse (i'd do your own function instead of calling `refract`). [a link] due to symmetry, you can know the fresnel on a smooth dielectric by just knowing the viewer position (fresnel of `ndotv` will be the same as fresnel of `ndotl`, since v fixes reflective and refractive l vectors, and reflective fresnel fixes the transmittance). best choice is to pick to refract when `randomsample.x>fresnel` then the probability of picking the refracted ray is `1.0-fresnel` and reflected is `fresnel` which is exactly the same as their weights in the bsdf meaning that for the probability weight of the sampling function they cancel out and you return `abs(cos(theta),0.0)` (for bsdfs the foreshortening term is abs not max).",0,0,0,0.9730976819992064,0.9894517064094543,0.9871604442596436,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
