buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW,comments,524583954,358,"ok i see that retrofitting this shit to work with `smaterial` and `icpumaterial/igpumaterial` is rather cumbersome. maybe after you get back it would make more sense to implement these 50% [a link] [a link] this means an `irenderpassindependentpipeline<>` and `icomputepipeline<>` without any `ipipelinelayout<>` objects implemented yet (that's just to much). in place of `ipipelinelayout<>` you can use the current `smateriallayer<>` `idriverpipelinecache` is a cache for helping to speed up the creation of new *compute* pipelines (separate from the runtime per-thread caching on opengl), there's an actual vulkan api object for that, but with opengl we could put that to some use, like storing introspection or compiled spir-v for parsed glsl + extension list. for now it can be an empty useless object. then at-least we: - disable/enable blend per fbo attachment - finally support all blending modes and factors on any fbo attachment separately - separate color mask per attachment - support all the render/raster states that vulkan advertises (lots of multisampling state) - finally support stencil operations properly (can rewrite oitzoo without bare opengl) - support the gl_patch primitive type without fucking guessing from whether we're using a tessellation shader this changes our asset hierarchy a bit, in the follwing way. ~ i<>meshbuffer -> i<>meshdataformat -> i<>buffer ~ i<>meshbuffer -> i<>renderpassindependentpipeline & i<>buffer -> i<>specializedshader & i<>pipelinelayout/smateriallayer so i<>meshbuffer takes over the i<>buffer vertex input bindings (so now vertex and index are stored in the same place) while i<>renderpassindependentpipeline replaces the remaining functionality of i<>meshdataformatdesc. i<>renderpassindependentpipeline also replaces everything except for `smaterial::texturelayer[]` which is now moved outside as a member of `i<>meshbuffer` instead. p.s. adding support for compute shaders might be super easy now, just an `ivideodriver::setcomputepipeline` + `ivideodriver::dispatchcompute{indirect}()` p.p.s. in vulkan compute and graphics pipelines can be set separately, we'll try to emulate the same with opengl.",-1,-1,-1,0.9733573794364928,0.842901349067688,0.9494302272796632,-1.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW,comments,670539562,497,"ok i think `clip_functor_t` needs an explainer [a link] you create the object by giving it the subresource (mip level and layer) of the original image, as well as the offset + extent to clip to, these are pretty much derived from your filter's state. you also pass it some texel-block-format info, but thats just for convenience and speed (it can derive those from the format). whenever you call the clip functor's function operator [a link] it will produce a `newregion` that is the intersection of the offset and extent of the functor and the offset and extent of `referenceregion`. now in order to produce such a region so its valid and is ""as-if"" it specified the image itself, you need to do the following: 1. resolve your `bufferwidth` if it was `0/-1` and similar because you need to know the byte-distance between successive rows and layers in a clipped region 2. find an offset that is both within the functor's state and the `referenceregion` (maximum of the coordinates) 3. find an extent that when added to the previously computed offsets is still within both rectangles (minimum of the coordinates with the maximum subtracted). `targetlimit` is the the one-past the max coordinate of the rectangle given in the constructor, while `resultlimit` is the equivalent for the input region. 4. compute a new `bufferoffset` given the change in the `offset` (offset can only become larger than the reference region so the `bufferoffset` shall be increased by a non-negative number) you can see step 2 and 3 being done starting on this line: [a link] if the two rectangles don't intersect (no common texels) then we return `false` [a link] the `offsetinoffset` cannot be negative: [a link]",0,0,0,0.9540778398513794,0.9849083423614502,0.983617067337036,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
