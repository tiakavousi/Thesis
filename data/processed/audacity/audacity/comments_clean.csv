833495776,835,crsib,2021-05-06T12:49:45Z,"only xcode 12.5 was broken, 12.4 worked fine, as obviously 12.3 does (as build succeeds on ci). 12.5, however, won't be able to build audacity master as well. i'm not sure if force push will be a great idea now, as anton has already started working from this branch. however, if you are worried about bisect in the future - we can do a squash merge. this will be less time-consuming and much safer. can you please post the full error? from the cmakeoutput.log? i'm not able to reproduce it with the clean build and everything builds fine with github actions. usually, `no cmake_c_compiler could be found` means some environmental problems."
833497370,835,Paul-Licameli,2021-05-06T12:52:17Z,"i think some interactive rebasing to simply this commit history would be useful. as i have said, don't squash everything into a big commit, rather, do leave logical steps of the project in place for easier review and possibly later bisection for debugging. but don't leave a record of mistakes and corrections made during development. squash the small corrections. what requires the macos deployment target minimum to increase from 10.7 to 10.9? if the xcode minimum to build also increases, then what is forcing that? explain these things prominently in commit comments. you introduce the libraries folder, which i also want to do in my misc-modules branch. are we agreed that: each sub-folder of libraries builds one library, which audacity depends on? each of these is (for now) shared? (though i might in future want to make certain of them static instead.) where should the compiled libraries be copied? (in my branch they simply go into the folder with the executable file.) and the code in libraries is always ""ours"", whereas anything in lib-src is only third-party code plus only small patches of ours that we must apply. yes? about white space preferences, i don't want to expend much time on those, but i do find it a little odd to see a space between a function name and the left parenthesis. i prefer to leave the space before the parenthesis only for if, for, and while."
833517852,835,crsib,2021-05-06T13:21:13Z,"at this point, force-pushing will break the day for another developer. rebasing into a fully compilable and runnable set of commits will be very time-consuming. so if you are concerned about bisecting the master - we can squash the request or create a merge commit. if we want to support developers running newer xcode versions and/or m1 hardware - we need to increase the target, because compiling for 10.7 and 10.8 is no longer supported. it is possible to take the xcode version and host system into account and configure it on this basis if we think that is critical to stay on 10.7, but i recall you wanted to raise min sdk version as well. yes. yes. this is system-dependent. currently, on macos, they will be placed into the frameworks directory. yes. **just to clarify the situation with xcode 12.5:** it was released last week (apr 26) and breaks the audacity build. there are two major issues: 1. looks like we cant compile for 10.7 anymore 2. we need to force cmake to use the legacy build system."
833527183,835,Paul-Licameli,2021-05-06T13:34:04Z,"i think what i suggested is a good rule for topic branches that are the work of one person. i do this sort of interactive rebasing of my own work in progress often, and i don't find it very time consuming. but collaboration with someone else does make force pushes difficult, that is true. i'd like to use c++17. you say developing on m1 also requires it. the increase of the minimum supported version is not strictly necessary, though, to make telemetry work in the product. is that right? so it's still not strictly needed to abandon 10.7 and 10.8 for that reason. still i hope that affects only a small minority of users."
833537942,835,crsib,2021-05-06T13:48:36Z,"rebasing is quick and fun :-) but in this case, it will be more of `git reset --soft` and then checking every commit against the ci. i hope that in the future we won't have the feature branches of this size. strictly speaking - this branch should be divided into like 5 different branches merged one by one, each for a library. the problem, however, that `lib-telemetry` is the main consumer of the functionality included in the other libraries now. that's right. i can implement a set of checks in the cmake that will set the `cmake_osx_deployment_target` based on the version of xcode and the host hardware. afaik 10.7 and 10.8 stand for less than 0.5% of the macos install base, that is hard to say how many audacity users are on this versions."
833545347,835,Paul-Licameli,2021-05-06T13:57:58Z,"think of some statistic we might want to know about the users -- and now we might write code to collect just that information! (if they opt in) (i'm not suggesting we necessarily build 3.0.3 for 10.7 still, just so collect the hard data on just how few really use it, and only then decide to abandon 10.7.)"
833562408,835,Paul-Licameli,2021-05-06T14:20:33Z,"those five little branches would add the lib-* one at a time, bottom up? that might be less overwhelming to review. the stuff in lib-* is all your work, not copied from elsewhere? i can't see yet in his fork how much work anton has done with dependency on your branch, which is why you don't want to force commit."
833622526,835,crsib,2021-05-06T15:37:19Z,"yep. but the most of the code is in lib-network-manager still it is mine, no 3d party code there"
833778895,835,spacekookie,2021-05-06T18:53:57Z,"i know me leaving a comment is not going to stop this feature being included in audacity, but i want to voice my opposition to this change anyway. feel free to ignore me if my opinion is inconvenient to you. i've never contributed to audacity, and haven't really engaged in the development of the project before. i have however used audacity for various audio editing tasks for the better part of a decade. and while i welcome the prospect of new development, and the project getting some of the updates it deserves, i am concerned about the use of analytics, from a principled stand point. we live our lives in a world where virtually every movement we make online, and many of the movements we make in the real world are subject to surveillance and tracking. it has been normalised to the point where the majority of people just put up with it, or don't question its usage. fundamentally tracking and analytics are about a power imbalance between the people doing the tracking and the people being tracked on. yes, i understand that this is opt-in, but that is how a lot of things started, and how they become normalised to the point where a lot of applications and websites _don't_ ask for permission first. worse, because a lot of users have been conditioned to think that tracking is normal, many will just press ""ok"" or ""yes"" to make an annoying dialog go away, not fully realising what they are consenting to. consent based on incomplete data is not truly consent. as i said, i am very happy to see that audacity is getting some love and attention from a design perspective. i'm excited to see how the project can be improved. but i am worried about the use of analytics, especially using large data mining companies (google & yandex) as a platform to do so. if you want to know what your users think about something, ask us. ask us directly and out in the open. don't spy on us. thank you for reading."
833778913,835,MrPetovan,2021-05-06T18:53:58Z,is telemetry opt-in only or do users have to disable it manually once they update to the next release?
833785461,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T19:03:34Z,"i agree with . i don't think these kinds of data collection are actually very helpful. the mixxx website had google analytics for years and in practice it never changed a decision we made. if you're going ahead with this, i think you owe it to users to explain in specific terms (not some vague ""this will help us improve audacity"") what you are planning to do with this data and how it is going to help users. you can get the information you need to improve audacity by listening to what users already say and watching them use the software in usability tests. as a harm reduction measure, i suggest to use a service that audacity hosts. collecting data about audacity users is one thing and sending that data to google and yandex is another. i would feel deceived if i thought i was opting into sending data to the audacity developers and later found out it was also going to google and yandex. i also suggest to guard this with a cmake option that defaults to `off`. i suspect some linux distributions will want to build without this. like users, packagers should have to specifically opt into this."
833794008,835,nils-van-zuijlen,2021-05-06T19:16:53Z,"also, you may want to think about the gdpr, google isn't known for respecting it... and although it only applies to ""personal information"", the definition of it isn't really precise, and an ip may be considered ""personal info"". ps: i'm no lawyer, that's why i used conditional... [a link] down below pointed out that ip is in fact a personal information, by law."
833801556,835,axb21,2021-05-06T19:29:04Z,"google is a monopoly and a bad actor and i do not want their spyware in audacity. please do not include it in any form. i've spent more time than i care to account for trying to divest from google and i don't want to have to worry that audacity is funneling data about me to them when i listen to or work with music tracks. i will simply stop using it. telemetry isn't that useful anyway. it's certainly not useful enough to justify selling out users to a very large surveillance company, in my view. please remove it completely."
833802256,835,Marie-Joseph,2021-05-06T19:30:14Z,"i'm just some rando, but i've been using audacity for at least a decade at this point, for everything from school assignments to experimental art. i will find something to replace it if this is merged. getting information about users would be more ethically conducted via a survey of some sort, linked to from the startup modal, ideally with a fully-qualified url and hosted by a site without tracking. at the very least then there would be more transparency for the user about who is collecting one's information, how, and what of that information is received by audacity developers. this could even be done - albeit with less automation - by linking to a forum thread whose sole purpose is to retrieve user feedback. the first post could explain the thread and provide a template for what information the developers would most like to have."
833808574,835,herzmut,2021-05-06T19:40:17Z,"telemetry won't tell you if users like the software or wish for a new feature. it only tells them they've been subjected to economic surveillance in an economic manner, and not even a decently useful one. let's face it: telemetry is useless. by its nature, it can't bear any context information, as the telemetry to read a user's mind is yet to be found. (a quest which hopefully never succeeds.) how comes that other successful open source software never had any use for analytics? blender, inkscape, gimp... afaik none of them utilitized google or yandex or any other corporate surveillance service and they're doing great without. some out-of-the-box thinking which innovative companies claim to be good at is probably what's required here."
833821994,835,ghost,2021-05-06T20:01:44Z,"in addition to all the above comments, i'd like to point out that mandating telemetry may hurt people with any issues related to connectivity. i hope you make this opt-in(and not google! google is terrible with privacy. look into ethical alternatives to data analytics!), rather than opt-out. don't spy on your users. let them tell you things."
833822556,835,ArneBab,2021-05-06T20:02:42Z,"audacity is wonderful software. it is great, because it works well at what it does. sending surveillance data to third-party companies is not part of that. if you want to collect data, please save it locally, without google or other intermediaries, and ask when you want to send it, giving me the option to inspect it beforehand. even better: allow me to enable recording my actions in a typical use-case and send you exactly this data as usage scenario. that way you get self-curated data which is much more useful for improving audacity, and you avoid selling our privacy to surveillance companies."
833824787,835,sandycorzeta,2021-05-06T20:06:17Z,"i guess we can learn from the past of where musecore did also having a backlash for implementing telemetry. since audacity now is part of mu.se group, its inevitable. ([a link] but yes... make it opt-in option and if possible, please give an option to disable to this feature in build/make parameter too."
833838117,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T20:28:37Z,"it is quite concerning that this comes so soon after the announcement regarding muse group. i was excited to learn that audacity was getting attention on its design, but this makes me concerned about what other questionable changes are coming for audacity in the future."
833840159,835,ivan-avalos,2021-05-06T20:31:42Z,"we need a community fork without telemetry and using a different branding, so, as soon as muse group implements more ~~privacy-abusing~~ people-abusing features, or decides to simply make audacity proprietary, development can continue independently."
833840933,835,yurkobb,2021-05-06T20:32:55Z,"there are two separate issues: 1. telemetry itself; 2. the sharing of user data with google analytics, yandex or other third-party for-profit ad-oriented companies. while telemetry itself is sometimes included in libre software (as explicit opt-in), i don't believe piping user behavior data into google analytics et al is a widespread practice in well-known free software projects yet. (i _may_ be totally wrong and other projects may already be doing this, but at least the explicit opt-in popups that i have seen as a user didn't mention google analytics). i suspect that gdpr-wise this might be an interesting legal problem not only for audacity but for linux distributions as well. please manage the telemetry data yourself instead, without using google analytics (perhaps by using self-hosted open-source tools). and make it opt-in, with clear consent (gdpr, again)."
833841340,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T20:33:33Z,let's not get hyperbolic here. audacity is licensed under the gplv2. nobody can make it proprietary.
833844145,835,ghost,2021-05-06T20:37:43Z,"if muse group holds the license to all the code, they can simply not release future versions under the gpl. the existing code would exist, but the other code wouldn't be gpl licensed."

833884135,835,SamantazFox,2021-05-06T21:35:48Z,"as a long time user, i'm really struggling to see why you'd want to add telemetry. first, it's going to google, which is kinda againsty the foss (free and open-source software) philosophy, and second, what is that going to help you with? audacity managed to be the best foss sound editing software you can get, with a lot of features, and without a bit of telemetry. if your goal is to provide a good piece of software to the foss community, then listen to the community instead of selling it to google, and ""trying to figure out what they want"" based on some numbers in a chart."
833886274,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T21:39:38Z,are users able to see the data that is collected or is that only available to a few audacity developers?

833905304,835,Chaz6,2021-05-06T22:11:07Z,one suggestion: make it clear in the permission dialog that telemetry uses google analytics rather than a private service you host yourself. this may be particularly of note to users who are covered by gdpr regulations.
833906949,835,ccoenen,2021-05-06T22:14:21Z,including it in the first place (opt-in or opt-out) is the problem. changing the default down the road is just too tiny a change (and maybe too tempting not to do it). this should not be included at all.
833911364,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T22:22:27Z,"some users are going to be upset if you merge any form of telemetry whatsoever. personally, my respect for audacity would increase if you really take the feedback here to heart, put in the work to switch to a self-hosted server, and work with us to make the gui design very specific and clear so users can easily make informed decisions about their privacy. i think you will get more complete and useful data if users feel they can trust you with it. edit: my [a link]."
833914225,835,GiovanH,2021-05-06T22:27:55Z,is there a specific issue or request that this pr addresses? i'm not seeing any reference here to the usual discussion a major change like this would usually require.
833914295,835,axb21,2021-05-06T22:28:01Z,"the commit stats on this are amazing to me: 5,506 lines of code inserted to implement telemetry that should not be in there. that is a substantial amount of code that certainly contains dozens of bugs and likely several security issues. that is enough code to be a maintenance headache for someone forever. that's also enough code to implement at least one cool new feature that end users actually want to have. why telemetry, in an already excellent piece of software? whyyyyyyyyyyyy?"
833915363,835,Be-ing,2021-05-06T22:29:58Z,most of that code is from vendored dependencies. the changes to the audacity code are quite small.
833917324,835,axb21,2021-05-06T22:33:45Z,"good point. so perhaps the ""dang, this could have been an actually useful feature"" part of my mini-rant is not as relevant. the rest is though--that's a lot of code, with potentially a lot of bugs and security holes, and you've already started documenting above! adding a bunch of new dependencies is worrisome generally speaking, too, let alone for this."
833917348,835,natevw,2021-05-06T22:33:50Z,"not going to dispute that this is a bad look, or might violate the gdpr, or even that it's a slippery slope and all that. but as a long time casual audacity user this is not the end of the world for me either: * at least it's google (motto: ""we're not evil:trade_mark:""), and not facebook (motto: ""hahah, whoops you caught us..."") * sounds like i will not be required to opt-in (and/or at least can opt-out, ...and block any initial attempts via little snitch until then ;-) and one thing that makes a big difference to me: * the telemetry agent looks to be custom code tracked in the repository itself, instead of dropping in some supply chain attack that an advertising company offers in pre-built form (and which may/may-not actually respect my tracking preferences behind the scenes!)"
833918134,835,SamantazFox,2021-05-06T22:35:18Z,yup. they're adding a whole network and http stack *just* for that.

834038939,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T03:36:12Z,"i tried to find discussion about this in the forum and could not. if you want to know more about how to improve audacity for users, i recommend switching to modern and more usable infrastructure, in particular migrating your old phpbb forum to discourse. this will make it nicer for users to tell you what they want."
834039616,835,GiovanH,2021-05-07T03:38:20Z,"the forum is an interesting idea, but really any github pr should be strongly linked to one (or more) github issues"

834043447,835,KevinVerre,2021-05-07T03:50:52Z,"i strongly recommend never putting any telemetry code into audacity. audacity is an open source music app for editing sound and music. you don't need numerical data and metrics and analytics to improve the app. it's not the end of the world if someone encounters an error and the developers aren't aware of it right away. what good could possibly come out of it? none. what bad could come out of it? lots privacy issues and bugs. from the pr: you can fix bugs as you encounter them. or as people report them and you are able to reproduce them. if you want, you can make logs and have people to upload those log files manually. you don't need to know which file formats are popular, you can just ask people to open issues if they want a file format supported. you don't need to know which effects are popular. prioritize improvements based on your own experiences with the app and encourage people to give written feedback. why does it matter which os version or audacity version people are using? that information should be private. if for some reason you really care you can create a poll."

834089404,835,Nexuist,2021-05-07T05:58:45Z,i'm so confused. why use off the shelf analytics software for this? you can run your own endpoint to collect events with like....one php file. and that could be open source too so we see exactly how you collect analytics data and decide for ourselves whether we want to opt in or not. why soil your non-controversial brand with associations to controversial ones? all of this just to avoid setting up a backend service that inserts rows into a table?
834091160,835,sam-ka,2021-05-07T06:01:00Z,please 1) make telemetry opt-in and 2) provide an easy way for users to see what technical information is collected *directly from within audacity*.

834218441,835,TOGLK,2021-05-07T09:42:25Z,"to whom it may concern, i speak as only an individual amongst the huge foss community, so value the following comments as just a representation of only my feelings & opinions on this matter. *but* take note that this is the **first** time that i have ever been so against a decision that i have felt that i needed to voice my opinion on it. so the first issue i have here is just how **poorly** the *audacity development team* have handled this entire push request/suggested changes process. you have failed from the very outset to identify that as a widely used and well loved foss, you will be, and must be, at all times subject to public scrutiny of decisions prior to **any** kind of code changes being submitted. your entire teams complete lack of transparency, and the failure of your team to respond adequately & promptly following such a strong public disagreement shows that the systems you have in place for managing public relations are an utter shambles and really need to have attention paid to them so that situations similar to this if they do occur in the future aren't pushed through with such complete disregard for end-users & package maintainers. now that i have highlighted the flaws in the poor execution of public relations with the community i shall now move on to addressing the actual code commit itself, it's contents, it's intentions, and it's usefulness. ##1.) the addition of telemetry inside of a foss project now that i have clearly outlined in the title of this section exactly what i will now cover you should hopefully be prepared to listen to and take note of the issues that i have with this change. foss prides itself on being highly privacy-focused and open, this is something that many people in the foss community see as a cornerstone of foss development, and it seems that the the audacity development team have failed to realise just how critical privacy is to many people that choose linux and foss as thier chosen methods of software interaction. telemetry is not welcome in foss software, regardless of the project, and as someone who helps support a foss project i can tell you from my own personal experience that telemetry is essentislly useless to most people looking to find faults with and fix bugs in software, the methods with which the data is gathered, and, the inability for that data to be understood from the users perspective mean that it is impossible to gain any useful context from telemetry data. the audactiy development team should be fully aware that telemetry is useless for all but some very invasive marketing and analytical subjections. ***why*** **did you ever think this was an acceptable change to make?** **do you think we are stupid?** under no circumstances should telemetry be included into audacity. it doesn't belong in foss projects under any circumstances. and, your attitude towards how you have handled it's suggested integration into audacity highlights your complete disconnection from the huge community that uses audacity. stop the process here and now. go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate the feedback you have recieved from the community on this matter. you'll learn a lot by listening to the communtiy and taking on-board the feedback that has been provided. don't make us fork this project just because you are unable to accept honest criticism from your end-users. do the right thing, work with us to improve the project in ways that the community want it to be improved. the last two points i was going to cover are frankly irrelevant because they don't even need to be considered once you taken on-board my feedback on the first point. but just in case you think you know better than your own end-users..... ***no google. no yandex.*** **no opportunity for discussions on the matter either. it's the communities way or the highway for the current audacity development team.** take heed, we want our values preserved, please don't fight against us on this matter."

834226077,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T09:53:47Z,not really a strong leg to stand on musescore has been littered with subscription only features and bolted to a closed source server infrastructure. with as far as i can tell little input from the community about if that is what they want. muse is about monetizing these apps not improving them.
834226461,835,CompSciOrBust,2021-05-07T09:54:19Z,currently over 99.97% of the reactions to the original commit are negative. clearly the users are overwhelming opposed to it. if it gets added that will be a massive middle finger to people who have used audacity all these years and will most likely result in a loss of users.
834228086,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T09:56:38Z,"btw ardour is free open source, has no tracking, and still manages to fund its self. btw its also got 90% of the features of audacity, and is a viable exit strategy for many. * cough * [a link] * cough *"
834228994,835,jxu,2021-05-07T09:57:54Z,"most users who were led here by reddit, hn, etc. it would be more fair to survey ""the typical audacity users"" (what telemetry does, but voluntarily). i think audacity users care about open source, but a lot of people couldn't care less and just use it because it's free. or maybe distro maintainers will decide whether or not to use a fork."
834230873,835,Frenzoid,2021-05-07T10:00:46Z,"getting back on topic.. sorry to say but google analitycs and datadog are ones of the most intrusive methods to datamine the user, the way and the ammount of data that it collects its disgustingly wide. i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable knowing that audacity uses it, even if there was a button to disable it."
834230959,835,phoe,2021-05-07T10:00:56Z,anecdotal data point: i'm a regular audacity user and i also learned about this issue via reddit. (i don't know if i would have learned about this in time if it wasn't for reddit/hn.) i assume that many of the people speaking in this thread actually use the application instead of participating in storms about applications they don't even use or haven't seen them used themselves.
834231964,835,TheEvilSkeleton,2021-05-07T10:02:32Z,"i understand the motive behind it but i disagree with this. while i do admit that telemetry is useless for the end user, it's *theoretically* only directly useless for them. if developers use telemetry properly, this will indirectly be useful for the end user as many more bugs will get squashed which will make it more stable and potentially faster, but that's only if developers use telemetry properly. i'm all for foss telemetry. i don't like opt-in or opt-out telemetry; i prefer a prompt at first launch that asks the user if they want to enable telemetry or not, which can then be enabled or disabled in the settings depending on what you chose initially. that being said, i'm all for foss telemetry. google analytics is something i will sincerely disagree with however."
834232432,835,CompSciOrBust,2021-05-07T10:03:16Z,"that may be the case but that doesn't mean when the average user hears about this and how it was added to audacity anyway despite the overwhelming concerns of other developers that there won't be a loss of users, not all users, most likely not a majority of users, but it will still drive people away from the program. are the benefits of telemetry worth that loss?"
834233129,835,jxu,2021-05-07T10:04:13Z,this response by tantracrul misses most of the complaints people have. i am not hopeful at this stage for the audacity team to actually listen to the feedback.

834238211,835,fpesari,2021-05-07T10:12:07Z,this imho (and the success of programs like blender) is the proof that floss projects work best as non-profit endeavors (e.g. foundations) backed by donations. we have to change the culture so that all users realize the value of floss programs they use and donate to feed the people who put their work into those programs!
834238221,835,jxu,2021-05-07T10:12:08Z,the success of a fork or a continuing series of patches depends on where the regular contributors contribute to. the same issue arose when youtube-dl got into hot water on github. have the regular contributors made any statements yet?
834239917,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T10:14:55Z,"yes, take a look at krita and ardour for positive examples of how to fund cooperative creative software. i recommend you have some discussions with the developers of those software about how they make it work in practice."

834242882,835,Gamewizard,2021-05-07T10:19:42Z,i am as an end user firmly in the camp this pull request should be rejected as one it raises serious privacy concerns and two it will cause a fork. if something like this is allowed in can i trust the audacity team any more? because from where i'm standing i can not and this is coming from a long time user that has used audacity in a professional context and suggested it to other people over the years. the fact parts of the code are obviously obfuscated to hide what they actually do and where they are sending data is worrying especially with the fact we know there are actors out there trying to initiate supply chain attacks on oss projects. edit: one thing i forgot to mention is i have no issue with some telemetry per say it's more the providers being used to process it as i know google has been caught in the past intentionally trying to link 3rd part apps and services using their analytics to their user tracking database. i do believe a better solution can be found with a little time with the greater community.
834243297,835,ghost,2021-05-07T10:20:21Z,yay another fork and revert
834243310,835,jxu,2021-05-07T10:20:22Z,it's true. i haven't seen a single ux improvement yet.

834245011,835,Eschryn,2021-05-07T10:23:14Z,the telemetry should be put behind a define so one could compile audacity without telemetry. opt in after compiling it and optional in the compilation process.

834285554,835,TheBeardOfTruth,2021-05-07T11:25:16Z,"i'm not a fan of telemetry in general, especially for a fully offline application. but my biggest concern lies with google and yandex, these are not privacy conscious companies nor do you have any control over how they use the data. (that's, of course, assuming the telemetry remains opt-in by default and that the behavior never changes, this seems unlikely to me seeing how this industry tends to operate so i'm strongly against it in general). notably this prompts the question ""how is this going to change over time?"" is it going to become mandatory in five years? is it going to then expand in scope? i suspect i'm not the only one finding this development concerning in both the short and long term."

834287482,835,sandycorzeta,2021-05-07T11:28:05Z,"yeah this is concerning too. if they ship it into macos also, should it have to be the ""dont send"" button that should be highlighted? because what i know about apple ecosystem is they designed it like that and giving no option to tracking."

834302222,835,Geofferey,2021-05-07T11:48:48Z,adding telemetry is a useless act when nearly all your users (linux distros) are gonna compile from source and create their own packages or downright disable it. all you are doing is shattering peoples faith. you obviously do not care about the previous user base of this application when you have decided to include telemetry that a majority has clearly expressed they don't want. who cares if you disabled it by default? in the end you are still leaving room for an opt-out scenario in the future and even more data gathering. when a company owns a piece of software these things are added for improving your profit not the users experience.
834305897,835,Tataarujin,2021-05-07T11:53:40Z,"whew, what a drama. i remember participating in another one, don't remember which one, got a lot of fun. crsib is a master troll, cristhiancc and igbc are your typical github moderation team pet lapdogs. i just hope audacity will stay as it is, open source and free for everyone and from any kind of telemetry (which is used for selling to advertisers, not for improving software) and that this topic will never be brought back."
834307609,835,transiient,2021-05-07T11:55:59Z,"this is ridiculous. **it is disabled by default and if you don't want to use it, you can keep it disabled.** though i have to agree with some people - you should probably use open source/foss analytics tools instead."

834308821,835,ftpmorph,2021-05-07T11:57:38Z,it's the type of information advertisers like to see when negotiating how much they'll pay for ad placement.
834309061,835,adryzz,2021-05-07T11:57:56Z,"imo, if you really want to add telemetry, you should add it like this: - log locally - at a successful restart delete the data - at a successful restart after a crash, ask to send it, and then delete it locally."
834309382,835,j0lol,2021-05-07T11:58:24Z,"not sure about others, but i for one would prefer to fill in a survey than telemetry. (i will always opt out of telemetry.) please provide ways for the user to talk about the program instead!"

834312378,835,richardk2016,2021-05-07T12:02:49Z,"the mere existence of google analytics in the code is already a violation of the gdpr in the eu. the fact that the software is used in education and schools makes it even more problematic. even more critical is the fact that the tracking could also capture the data of minors. anyone (admin or school board responsible) who makes the software available unchecked and explicitly approved (in each individual institution) even just makes himself liable to prosecution under certain circumstances. she (or he) risks a fine and the loss of his job. if you want to see the software disappear into insignificance within a very short time, stay on this path. i work for a school board and - for my own self-protection alone - i will suggest to my superiors that the software be banned immediately in all schools in the state if there is a risk that it may contain unlawful tracking."

834315186,835,eunakria,2021-05-07T12:06:34Z,"thing is, that's crash reporting, not telemetry. crash reporting is still immensely useful, and audacity's also considering adding it via breakpad. telemetry is collecting information about platform, high-level usage context and performance, to help understand how the software is running when everything is working, rather than why it's failed when it has failed. telemetry is easier to argue shouldn't be present at all. crash reporting is way easier to justify. i mentioned before that i find telemetry super useful for my own software, and i don't mind audacity adding it; they should just be conscious about privacy, more so than they are right now by sending the data off to google and yandex. otherwise, i totally agree with you."
834315749,835,Tataarujin,2021-05-07T12:07:17Z,someone who will have the _audacity_ to fork it. i'll see myself off.

834316838,835,Frenzoid,2021-05-07T12:08:37Z,"thats ok, but you jump too quickly :c. not everyone posting a meme is insantly a bad user. memes are a way of expressing ourselves, and can be used to point out the mood of a conversation before it escalates, its true that we are adults here, but that doesnt mean that the convesation has to be stricly formal."
834317600,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T12:09:35Z,this is the sort of work a lot of distros already do. in researching this pr i found that debian have been modifying audacity privately for years just to keep the damn thing working on their os.
834317805,835,d-damien,2021-05-07T12:09:52Z,"i can understand the desire to know users os, as it allows indeed to support more users more effectively, but there are free/libre telemetry and helpdesk support systems. more generally i have been thinking about the state of free/libre softwares support tooling recently. often you will see a software great in its own field, but that uses a proprietary chat room system, forum, or telemetry. there should be more collaboration and free projects should offer support to other free projects when possible. you run a free forum ? offer to run \ 's forum."
834317983,835,eunakria,2021-05-07T12:10:07Z,"see the clarification of the pr. support for telemetry is only enabled by default in the official builds. if you build from source, it won't even ask if it's okay to send data; you're safe and sound. that said, i'm not sure if audacity supports reproducible builds. considering they have all their dependencies included in the main git tree, rather than as submodules or traditional dependencies, i'm a little worried about their architecture. i'm no expert with audacity (i use it casually and have never made any contributions to it) but this kind of software tends to have certain difficulties with building cleanly and consistently. **edit:** it's still concerning to me that they're including intrusive telemetry, but this reply is to clarify there's an official way to disable it from builds altogether. i guess there's solace in at least that."
834318354,835,agateblue,2021-05-07T12:10:41Z,"just wanted to share some support for the people working on this. i actually think telemetry data could prove extremely useful to understand how the software is used in the wild, and what are the potential pain points. as long as it's opt-in, disabled by default, and there is a clear communication about what is sent, when, why and to whom, i don't think it's such big deal. and it seems to be the case. that being said, an other backend than google analytics or yandex for storing and querying the data would be nice, but hey, what good enough alternatives are available out there?"

834322885,835,waffshappen,2021-05-07T12:17:03Z,"why is there a plan to send my usage data for audacity as additional data points to an ever-growing analytics and telemetry monster instead of the fabled eighth magnifying glass i was promised tantacrul? but seriously: if you do analytics **please** selfhost it. who has access, how long and when will it be deleted - and even better, how much will be made public so others can benefit - should be mandatory statements - as well as help compliance. and make ""no"" the highlighted default. i know it sucks and it will lead to less users agreeing (which effect does the close button/esc call? default? none?) to send usage data but that will be the most friendly, agreeable and least resistant way - plus 100% gdpr/dsgvo compliant too. and while i value the effort to take audacity into the current century with a more consistent design after you applauded the amazing open source community please dont disappoint the same with the first action being telemetry to some of the biggest privacy violating monsters despised by floss out there. we're all rooting for you to do the right thing."
834323989,835,falkTX,2021-05-07T12:18:27Z,"as a side effect from this, which was touched by others but only briefly, is that audacity team will only receive analytics reports from a certain, very specific kind of people. if new developments and ideas happen because of the results of these analytics, it will be focused only on these people, no way around it."
834324064,835,alex-tee,2021-05-07T12:18:33Z,this is how zrythm does it ![a link] example bug report that gets generated: [a link]
834324398,835,ITotalJustice,2021-05-07T12:19:01Z,this is by far the best way. bonus points for making the logs easy and intuitive to find so the average user can participate in submitting bugs with logs.
834326198,835,collinalexbell,2021-05-07T12:21:13Z,"i really like the log local, ask to send approach. i personally would like to see what type of data is being sent as well... there could even be a ""always send"" option that will cause a window to pop up that announces it is sending the data (along with an option to opt out of the ""always send"" mode), but otherwise just works in the background."
834328822,835,eunakria,2021-05-07T12:24:34Z,"the idea of this being a slippery slope itself seems preposterous to me - as much as you might want to assure yourself with it, companies and projects are not inherently disposed to become evil once they get big. again, i don't support the way audacity is implementing telemetry, but i know how useful it can be as someone who includes it in my own software. *i'm not interested in any profit incentive;* i would leave it out if i didn't gain anything from it. but knowing who my users are and how well my software is performing for them, is incredibly helpful. i expect audacity feels the same about this. google and yandex software range from cheap to free and are super easy to integrate, but they are ethical monstrosities. i've already spoken against the inclusion of any link to their platforms in audacity. however, i believe telemetry can absolutely be done ethically and productively. being able to gauge audacity's user base will greatly help them as a platform, i believe, and to this extent, i'll support them. what's so evil about knowing how many users you have and how generally they use your software? it's not going to spiral out of control."
834330448,835,ledoge,2021-05-07T12:26:43Z,"this is ridiculous. your response to hundreds of users telling you they don't want their data to be shared with the privacy nightmare that is google shouldn't be ""we'll replace it only if we can find something better"". if you can't find a solution for telemetry that the userbase can be happy with, like kde's approach, then you shouldn't add telemetry at all. the fact that you're even considering adding google analytics at this point clearly shows that you aren't taking this feedback seriously. if you don't do a complete 180 on this, i expect that there'll be a fork that'll split the community."
834330522,835,JShorthouse,2021-05-07T12:26:49Z,"how about they just ask their users instead? like how we found out people's opinions on things for the entirety of human history? telemetry is invasive, anti-social, underhanded, and not even an effective tool. no amount of numbers and statistics is ever going to tell you *why* people are doing a certain thing or how they feel using your software. ""90% of people are using this feature"" is completely meaningless when you have no idea if they're pulling their hair out and punching the wall the entire time they're using it."
834330976,835,ghost,2021-05-07T12:27:25Z,"this. or at the very least, use a self-hosted, open-source telemetry platform. not google analytics... i completely understand how this data _could_ be useful to improve audacity, and i want to assume good faith here. but this is not the way."

834346903,835,obfuscoder,2021-05-07T12:46:21Z,"to reflect on the given reasons why this feature was built in: 1. ""audacity is widely used across several platforms, but we have no information on the application stability"" on almost all platforms it is possible to catch fatal exceptions and let the user decide whether they want to report that crash. with the permission of the user (and this permission is only for that very crash and not all crashes after that), this crash report can be sent to servers owned by the community instead of sending them to google&co to further process them and fix the bug. 2. it is difficult for us to estimate the size of the user base accurately. i'm not sure how this would make audacity better. you have the download statistics. those numbers will be significantly higher and closer to the actual user base than the number of users actually agreeing to that telemetry feature. if you want to actually know the number of users, you can ask the user once during installation or start up whether they would like to let this known. again this information should be going to community servers instead of google&co. apart from that, trying to know the exact user base is only good for one thing; letting investors know how much potential customers they have to milk. 3. we need a way to make informed decisions about which os versions to support. for example, can we raise the minimum version of the macos to 10.10 to update the wxwidgets to the latest version? again, download statistics can help here or an optional questionaire on the download page or once at first startup. 4. we have a known issue with the new file format introduced in audacity 3.0. we found it with the great help of the community members on our forum. however, there is no way for us to estimate the impact of these issues on users. is it just a random case? do we need to rush the work on the recovery tool or help the users one by one? or do we need to rethink the file format to make it safer and more easily recoverable? telemetry does not help with prioritizing bugs. bugs are usually not visible in telemetry data as bugs have the tendency to be unaccounted for and thus there is no telemetry data to count particular bugs. after all, why adding telemetry to understand a bug, instead of ""just"" fixing it? also the number of users watching a particular issue (or the already mentioned crash report) will give you enough hints about how important a bug is."
834351418,835,ccoenen,2021-05-07T12:51:23Z,"to the poeple suggesting compile-time flags and distributions taking this feature out: great, you're looking for a solution for **you**. how about we all agree that nobody likes tracking (at best, people are *indifferent* to tracking!) and that we don't want it in any version of audacity? if we debate ""opt-in"" vs. ""opt-out"", we've already lost the most important battle. this feature should not be part of the code. saving linux builds or self-compiled builds will not be helpful to the general user base of this program. if it's in the default, precompiled windows installer, that's probably used for 60% or more of all people using audacity. and we're debating to screw them over. so: no tracking, please. it's not exactly complicated. not ""opt-in"". not ""i can compile it away, i am so smart"". no ""we're forking this"". no tracking. period."

(note: this list is based on my own rough review, i didn't look at the first post before! i might also not be 100% correct, it was only a quick and dirty look at the code.) both google universal analytics and yandex metrica are used. it appears that the collected information is sent directly to google and yandex.ru (but not everything appears to be sent to yandex.ru). this also means they know your ip. knowing your ip, in combination with os name, version, audacity version, etc. could be used for fingerprinting, similar to browser fingerprinting. there is a chance you could be de-anonymized with this information. although i don't know if the information would be enough to fully de-anonymize someone, it is certainly in the realm of possibilities. also, this pr is called ""basic telemetry for the audacity"". this implies that is is planned to add even more telemetry features in future, thereby increasing the chances of de-anonymization. the fact that google and yandex are used for tracking doesn't make it any better. google has like a billion tricks up their sleeve to track you. i don't know about yandex, but they too are a big corporation. i conclude that all claims of anonymity are very questionable. however, with this change, audacity will lie to the user by claiming that this tracking is completely anonymous. this is almost certainly a gdpr violation waiting to happen. someone somewhere in the eu will probably install an audacity build for an institution but tracking was ""accidentally"" enabled and now they're in trouble. i've already read comments of people who will go full ""scorched earth"" mode and get rid of all audacity installation because they don't want that even just 1 bit is sent to google or other tracking companies. also, this is certainly a violation of informed consent, since it suggests anonymity while this claim stands on very thin ice. but let's not overlook the elephant in the room: overall, this change is obviously completely useless for the user and no user wants this. from the user point of view, this feature is always bad since it has a risk of de-anoymization. in other words, this is an anti-feature. the discussion of opt-in vs opt-out is a distraction. the only reasonable decision here is complete rejection."

834543942,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T15:39:44Z,": this is a good start, with 3000 people stating they are disapproving, confused or concerned it seems that the initial proposal was less than well considered. strictly optional for who? implementing an opt-in/opt-out dialog indicates that by default you are expecting this code to be compiled into the application this seems rather disingenuous. the vast majority of users do not compile this code themselves. they get it from an upstream that compiles it for them, therefore the average user will have no way of knowing if this code is compiled into the application until they start it. and this is a valid use case... however, having a valid use case doesn't make the jump to using api's from privacy disrespecting third parties an obvious solution. having identified the need and use case the obvious next step should have been to start a conversation how to best implement this feature, and make certain identify: - impact of the feature on developers - impact of the feature on users - how to safeguard user information - what is the chain of custody for the information being gathered - what is the life cycle for the information - what features will be available to users to see the information that is being gathered - what types of transparency are the developers going to maintain around this information cross-site tracking is not necessary for google to take the information supplied to them and use it against other sources they gather information from in order to fingerprint the user. this kind of data mining operation is precisely what they have been known to do for years now. this is more than enough information for google to use it in their mining operations. did you consider anything else? i did a quick thought experiment about other common applications that i know that gather information. what did i come up with? well, i'm using firefox, and i know they gather information all the time. so, i did a quick double check to see what their documentation / statement is around the information they gather. they are very clear and transparent: [a link]. i note they have some very carefully stated guidelines surrounding the gathering and use of this information: your proposal is that you have an on / off switch, with no indication of: 1. where the information is stored? 2. how long the information is stored? 3. what (if anything) will be done to anonymize the information? 4. who will have access to the information (including any third parties)? 5. if the user turns off the option later, when will their information be deleted? speaking to #3 above, it's definitely necessary as you have stated: the simple faq style document from mozilla addresses a number of these concerns, and links to more in depth information regarding the gathering of this information and all of the technical details of how it is used. this is the kind of transparency that needs to be included when addressing this kind of situation. one of the nicer things about mozilla's implementation is they have a whole, publicly available portal for information surrounding the telemetry they gather: [a link] - nothing in your proposal suggests that you would implement anything similar. also, very noteworthy: mozilla has a **whole open source [a link]** for this application. this is the kind of implementation that should have been considered before even one line of code was written to try to implement this., the big takeaway here, is that as a developer you have misunderstood the practice for implementing a large new feature. from a technology standpoint it is simple. the hard part is the **policy, procedures and processes** that are needed to support this feature. the code is the easy part, it's working with the whole community that is difficult, but it is absolutely critical."
834545807,835,PureIncompetence,2021-05-07T15:41:31Z,as they're obviously do not take the concerns of thousands of their users serious - waiting for forks to come. get ready to become the openoffice of audio software.

(ie, what's gathered, how long it's kept, how it's used, etc.) 3. were there any internal discussions before the decision was made to implement this feature? 4. were there any public conversations before this feature was implmented? 5. what is the data retention policy surrounding this information? 6. were there any steps taken in light of regulations that could influence how this information is kept? 7. what procedures are followed to keep this information secure? i do find it a little disheartening to hear that ardour is storing the ip address. it would seem to me that during a check-in it would be possible to notify users of updates, and once that is done then the ip address is not really needed and could be scrubbed from the stored information. if you are looking to build more usage data, then an anonymized uuid should be used instead of the ip address. edit: changed: """"check-in"" system is something that anyone would object to.."" to """"check-in"" system is something that most would object to.."""

834638000,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T17:25:01Z,"that's regrettable. hopefully this is a topic that might be re-considered in the future. imo - i think the idea of using the check-in system is useful, and i think it would be possible to anonymize a uuid. the reason ip's aren't anonymous is precisely what you commented on below: gleaning the locations is what should be anonymized. it is something that could be derived during the communication and stored, instead of storing the ip address itself. just a bit of feedback. and, for what it's worth, i don't think gather the information you've described is a violation of anyone's privacy, it's good usage / demographic information. i would still like to hear more about the other items i asked about if you have time to discuss them. thanks again!"

834668107,835,crashvb,2021-05-07T18:15:24Z,"even if the pr is merged, the people who care will look for alternative solutions and / or find methods to disable the telemetry anyways (patches, jailing, egress rules, etc). ... which kinda defeats the purpose of the telemetry in the first place, as it will only be available for a subset of the overall user-base, and likely only serve to complement other kinds of metrics (popularity contests, download counts, pr participation, etc). ... while i'd agree that protesting alone does not work (... alternative proposals tend to do better), it's not a totally a wasted effort; after all, the decision to make the feature opt-out was **a calculated one**, and implies that the data belongs to them, unless you're smart enough to stop them."
834671617,835,AndreiSva,2021-05-07T18:21:15Z,i still don't understand why using google analytics would be a good idea. it takes little effort to set up a a self hosted telemetry.
834674850,835,AndreiSva,2021-05-07T18:26:24Z,i doubt many distributions will go out of their way to enable that option. if this pr gets merged the people who actually have the telemetry enabled is so low that it completely defeats the point of having telemetry in the first place.
834688004,835,falkTX,2021-05-07T18:47:07Z,"something curious i found. the recent changes on their wiki mention a few updates on the analytics documentation page made today [a link] they still keep insisting that this is all annonymous. from [a link] the use of uuid, ip and a few other details makes it really pseudonymous at best. granted, they do not intend to record personal data, but end up helping facilitating that."
834688303,835,immibis,2021-05-07T18:47:40Z,"all this stuff? it's what people say they'll do, every time it's happened in the past. almost always, it doesn't happen. you don't have to agree or disagree, because reality agrees. btw since it prompts you on startup, there is no difference between opt-out and opt-in. you just call it opt-out to make it sound worse. i'll note there is no way to avoid recording ip. however, the uuid is totally unnecessary. so is the timing and order of events. all they really want to know is: how long was the app used in total, and how many times was each option used, over a period of say a week."
834689200,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T18:49:10Z,yes there is. don't put it in the logs.
834690202,835,immibis,2021-05-07T18:50:52Z,"there's no way for an end user to know whether it's logged or not. they could say they're not logging it, but then log it anyway."
834691844,835,dpedu,2021-05-07T18:53:24Z,"congratulations, you've proposed the most unpopular change in the history of this project. but at least you're aware of the concern. will you act on it? give it up or be forked."
834692080,835,falkTX,2021-05-07T18:53:49Z,"if you never send analytics data, there is nothing to record ;) ;)"
834692944,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T18:55:17Z,"that's true. we'd have to take their word for it, which requires trusting them. speaking for myself, my trust for muse group is hanging by a thread at this point. what they need to do to *start* rebuilding it is to immediately, unambiguously commit to not using google analytics nor yandex."
834703302,835,notpushkin,2021-05-07T19:06:41Z,"personally, i'm not against **strictly optional, disabled by default** telemetry if you specify which services (google? yandex?) you're using right in the box as opposed to the privacy policy link on the screenshot. right now it's like you're ashamed of using google (which you should) and hiding it (which isn't good). if you don't want to be ashamed and still roll analytics, please try to set up your own analytics software (there are a few options, from matomo to plausible to rolling your own script that logs events in a table and using things like metabase to build reports from that). it's really easy nowadays and a capable server should cost like $20/mo, so that shouldn't be that big of a deal."
834708636,835,immibis,2021-05-07T19:09:53Z,fyi for devs: you've been brigaded from reddit. [a link]
834710563,835,y4my4my4m,2021-05-07T19:13:16Z,"i dont come from reddit and i oppose those changes. what do they need my ip address for if it's to help debug stuff? please, lol."
834711947,835,orenwatson,2021-05-07T19:15:40Z,i found out from a non-programming related discord. i recommend you salvage what is left of your and tantacrul's reputation.
834712930,835,klardotsh,2021-05-07T19:17:26Z,"i don't come from reddit (i heard about this via a mastodon followee) and i still think this pr is actively harmful to audacity, its users, and the free audio community broadly - both if merged, and frankly, at this point, even if it's not, in light of what seems to be a lack of willingness to change course to address the plethora of community concerns. i would feel this way whether i'd read zero or a million words of commentary around this thread and the underlying implementation. furthermore, ""brigading"" is a fairly loaded term to use for what was someone sharing a link. this is the internet. links are shared all the time - it's the literal entire point."
834713197,835,sirocyl,2021-05-07T19:17:57Z,"it's more than reddit, i see this issue's popped up on /g/ a bit ago, and it's been getting passed around irc, mastodon, twitter, matrix, telegram and discords here and there. it is not a small issue, and i'm surprised comments have not been restricted to contributors here yet."
834713800,835,dpedu,2021-05-07T19:19:00Z,"turns out that when an open-source project does something wildly unpopular, the word spreads."
834714438,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T19:20:09Z,the only project that would get a stronger reaction than audacity would probably be if the linux kernel tried to do something similar. audacity is very proud of how many users their app has. a lot of those users feel that the foss values of the project are very important.
834714743,835,nathanfranke,2021-05-07T19:20:41Z,i hope y'all are connected to github with a vpn and throwaway account
834715903,835,karthanistyr,2021-05-07T19:22:41Z,"guys, you're in the news [a link]"
834715918,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T19:22:42Z,now that things have quietened down i think its important to remember this is the first battle in a long war for who controls the interests of audacity. people stating that the devs will push this change through quietly have plenty of cases to back them up. from here on out the community needs to ruthlessly review every single pr going into this project and every single commit going into master. until they give up or the money runs out.

834716896,835,klardotsh,2021-05-07T19:24:27Z,"[a link] adds nothing of value to this, or any, discussion. we can go down that rabbit hole all day and it will still do nothing but waste everyone's time."
834717045,835,sirocyl,2021-05-07T19:24:45Z,"i'm neither surprised nor disappointed - so far the discussion has remained, for the most part, civil here - and in case y'all missed it (i did) - there is a statement made in the op above, about the use of telemetry, library cruft and what not. while i'm glad they addressed it, i'm still unhappy with the decision to push forward as it is - though, i would be incredibly relieved if they saw it fit to work out a self-hosted telemetry service to use on public builds. another option imo, would be to entirely separate telemetry-enabled builds on the audacity download page, and gate that behind a strict privacy policy, for compliance's sake. this makes it an opt-in proposition at download time - and, at first-run. that way, users deploying audacity en masse, which can ***not*** have telemetry on their network for understandable reasons, can continue using a supported version of audacity, rather than a fork or a build from source."
834717510,835,immibis,2021-05-07T19:25:35Z,cause it's impossible to send anything over the internet without an ip address...?
834718368,835,y4my4my4m,2021-05-07T19:27:07Z,they don't need to log it.
834718826,835,immibis,2021-05-07T19:27:54Z,"correct, but there is no way to prove they aren't logging it, so we have to assume they are anyway"
834719428,835,sirocyl,2021-05-07T19:29:04Z,"small request - could you specify what requirements you're looking for specifically, perhaps in a new issue report, for a non-google/non-yandex and/or self-hosted telemetry service? the community has answers, but this pr comment space is getting crowded for sure."
834720332,835,nnnn20430,2021-05-07T19:30:45Z,it's not brigading when it's the wider free software community/users responding...
834723486,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T19:36:03Z,"this makes it an opt-in proposition at download time - and, at first-run. that way, users deploying audacity en masse, which can not have telemetry on their network for understandable reasons, can continue using a supported version of audacity, rather than a fork or a build from source. i think this is a great idea. several users have already mentioned that they are responsible for usage of audacity in educational settings. in schools, universities, governmental agencies, companies, and other institutions with mass deployments of computers, it would be easier for them to use audacity without a shred of doubt about compliance with institutional and legal policies if [a link] hosts official builds with the telemetry not even compiled into the binary. in a mass deployment, it would be inconvenient to ensure that the checkbox for telemetry is disabled on every single computer. with github actions, this would be really easy to implement using the matrix feature."

834728848,835,crashvb,2021-05-07T19:44:47Z,"... some people actually do care, and things can change. to think otherwise is feed into complacency. what people do and say matters. (if all this is for not, then what is the point of the pr -- or this dialog -- in the first place; just merge and be done with it). no, i'm calling it opt-out because it, in-fact, requires end users to ""opt out"" (the shinny blue default button in the mockup ;) , aside from the other comments about config defaulting) ... if the opt-out model sounds worse to you, that is inferred. would things change so much if users were required to check a box to **enable** telemetry; perhaps with the same catchy rationale above it? ... yes, it would, because most users will not read the message, and as a consequence, telemetry would not be collected. the whole point of defaulting **on** is to collect information from those uses who indifferent, not paying attention, or are uninformed. i think it is more appropriate, and in better taste, to produce software in an ethical manner and air on the side of caution for people who might not know any better, then it is to aggregate metrics. (... a different way of saying it, with using that other phrase ...)"
834732927,835,immibis,2021-05-07T19:51:25Z,i'll believe it when i see your fork become more popular.
834733973,835,crashvb,2021-05-07T19:53:08Z,"oh, you got me there, maybe i should change the way i think about the world ..."
834734712,835,falkTX,2021-05-07T19:54:26Z,"that is the thing, it doesnt have to. for something to become a success, all it takes is 1 person using it and being grateful for it. vscodium is a thing for those that need to run vscode (say the rest of the team is using the same tool and has a defined workflow for it) but are not ok with all the tracking and eula associated with it. vscodium is never going to be more popular than vscode, but because people use it, in my opinion it is already a success. it serves a purpose and serves it well. those that care will find it and use it. the developers that fork and create such projects are not interested on popularity contests, but about being useful."
834736760,835,AndreiSva,2021-05-07T19:57:43Z,vscode is still more popular than vscodium.
834736855,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T19:57:53Z,ooh where do i download that? need that.
834737579,835,orenwatson,2021-05-07T19:59:08Z,"but the thing is, unlike audacity, most people think of vscode as being a free tier of a microsoft product, not as a oss product. therefore, expectations are exponentially lower, given m$'s ancient reputation"
834738640,835,x-0n,2021-05-07T20:00:57Z,"dear obviously confused committer, i'm not from reddit. i'm a random guy who knows audacity exists, simply because it's one of the most well-known, most complete and most appreciated floss alternatives to proprietary software. please consider to stop fucking with it. you're making it worse. go back to your shitty commercial offerings that noone has ever heard about and stuff all your shitty telemetry, antipatterns and ui redesigns in there. in other words, kindly fuck off. best regards, the internet"
834743169,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:08:37Z,"oh yea my favourite thing about this muse takeover is they have promised to ""fix"" the gui. :grinning_squinting_face: the gui in audacity may not be pretty (and there's a couple of bugs) but its one of the most straight forward and intuitive interfaces i have ever used. in fact i have seen it be used as a case study for good interface layout before. making it pretty doesn't make it better."
834748865,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T20:19:25Z,": i suggest taking a perspective more like these developers: : : please don't base your decisions on whether to continue support for a feature or operating system on necessarily unrepresentative numbers. drop support for features when maintaining them becomes an obstacle to moving forward with the rest of the project. it doesn't matter if one person or ten million people use the feature. if it needs to go, it needs to go. if not, keep it."
834749174,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T20:20:02Z,"hi the majority of this response is very useful... i'll just add a few follow up comments where there might be some more interest: it would be a good idea if there were... say the way mozilla approaches it: [a link] that's at least some consideration of the user base. :) now that is something that i would suggest could be improved. as noted in the firefox document i linked above, they keep the data for 13 months, while removing ip addresses every 14 days. from what i've read (from documents like [a link] guide), they tend to view ""personal data"" in the broadest terms possible. since ip addresses can be used to compel information from a service provider, it is generally regarded as personal information. just some food for thought. imo - while the fact that this url only presents aggregate information is good, having an unpublished url that is public facing (if it is, in fact public facing) is not. this is an attack surface that someone who found the url could use to try to gain access to the database itself. yes, you mentioned this in other posts. personally, i don't see the issue with gathering such information as it might be of use for other purposes (ie, identifying which versions of ardour are still in wide use, identifying which platforms are most active - like you have already stated, how often ardour is being used, and possibly a lot more). i think the main point is to (a) secure the information as strongly as possible, and (b) keep the information as anonymous as possible. it sounds like these were considerations when it was first implemented. if anything, i would suggest that this topic could be re-investigated to update things to more current standards. it's this kind of thinking that should be present in this pr that i think many of us are not seeing / reading... my hope is that this discussion might provide more of an example to musecorp about what users would like to see discussed about such an implementation."
834752823,835,NWPlayer123,2021-05-07T20:26:56Z,"the fact that they're calling it a product means it's already dead to me as foss, telemetry or not."
834753366,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T20:27:55Z,"hi paul, i was responding to the person that stated the telemetry should be left on permanently with no option to disable it. this would not be acceptable to most distributions."
834754088,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:28:41Z,"amen, to that, i have been waiting for someone to say this for the last 24h"
834754912,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T20:29:51Z,"probably, but i figured there was a chance he was serious so i thought a serious response was worthwhile."
834757641,835,car1ox,2021-05-07T20:34:53Z,f in the chat for old good audacity. what's a good name for the fork?
834758248,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T20:35:57Z,i postulated libreaudio earlier... borrowing from libreoffice forking off of openoffice.org
834758755,835,car1ox,2021-05-07T20:36:55Z,f in the chat for old good audacity. what's a good name for the fork?
834758776,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T20:36:57Z,that's already [a link].
834758781,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T20:36:57Z,there's an audio player named audacious.
834761310,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:41:29Z,"i say we call it audacity. you know cos we have the audacity to call it audacity. (yea i know i know, i am going)"
834762457,835,Sciss,2021-05-07T20:43:42Z,"audacity origin ;-) __edit:__ but jokes aside, i thought _audience_ was pretty nice, if there is no conflict with existing software."
834762946,835,GiovanH,2021-05-07T20:44:34Z,glad to see this made a draft.
834763098,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:44:51Z,it should probably get some practical and boring name like libreaudio until someone can come up with a good pun.
834763688,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:45:56Z,baby steps: next get the pr closed altogether then get removed from the list of people with write access altogether.
834764930,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:48:10Z,(not in the topic) came up with audacium (audacity and chromium stuck together)
834766910,835,jxu,2021-05-07T20:50:01Z,maybe this is a situation where a benevolent dictator leadership model would've helped. torvalds would've rightfully cursed these changes out.
834769730,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:51:28Z,"stallman is the counterpoint of when a benevolent dictator goes wrong however. finding a truly benevolent dictator is hard. frankly i prefer the rust model where everyone even the lead devs are held to a set of community rules and processes for implementing changes, its a model where no one is above the law, and no one's voice is permitted to be louder than anyone else's (within practical reason). it's not perfect but it significantly reduces the amount of drama in the rust world. (so far the discussion has been polite please don't flame me on this one)"
834771731,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T20:52:30Z,i agree that this pull request should be closed at this point. any alternative implementation should start fresh in a new pull request *after* discussing with the community how to do it in an acceptable way. i'm still waiting on an unambiguous statement that audacity will not use google analytics nor yandex.
834772506,835,processor286,2021-05-07T20:53:30Z,audiocity ?
834773917,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T20:55:50Z,i feel we need another poll :grinning_squinting_face:
834773920,835,jxu,2021-05-07T20:55:50Z,call it cacophony lol
834776107,835,Sciss,2021-05-07T20:59:47Z,"it would probably be wise to discuss a possible fork, its naming etc. somewhere else? the thread gets out of hand, and project maintainers (somewhat rightfully) could close/ lock it at some point. it could be on the audacity user forum, or better suggestions?"
834776652,835,spacekatia,2021-05-07T21:00:48Z,could call it animocity (portmanteau of animosity and audacity)
834776872,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T21:01:08Z,oh i thought the point of having it here was to remind the dev's we are not going away. this isn't over just cos the thousands of tryhards from reddit and hn have stopped
834778088,835,jxu,2021-05-07T21:03:16Z,"i presume we haven't had an ""official response"" from either muse group or debian/arch/other distro maintainers yet."
834778550,835,Qix-,2021-05-07T21:04:07Z,they are working on one. that much has been confirmed.
834780181,835,jxu,2021-05-07T21:06:49Z,"given that all of the muse group people have not even considered removing google and yandex, the most controversial sticking points, i'm not hopeful."
834780544,835,marcopavanello,2021-05-07T21:07:25Z,ohoh what about ana ? it stands for ana is not audacity :) or even audacity is not audacity if you will.
834780746,835,spacekatia,2021-05-07T21:07:47Z,"duplicity is another neat one, a constant reminder of why people started the fork (also because it's a duplicate of audacity)"
834780848,835,Be-ing,2021-05-07T21:07:56Z,they are considering it. they have not committed to not using google analytics and yandex.
834781022,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T21:08:16Z,"i would suggest you look at the community you are addressing this to: libreoffice is the result of a fork from openoffice.org when oracle took it over and started making changes that met with major disapproval. the maria database came about from the same situation with oracle taking over mysql. neovim came about because some users felt that the development speed and direction of vim wasn't moving in the right direction (it wasn't even an issue was controversial as this one). you should learn some history about the open source world. there is a long history of projects being forked when there are issues that developers have ignored their users feedback. no, reacting with a thumbs down is an indicator that your comment doesn't deserve support because it is a deeply flawed and ignorant argument."
834782088,835,AndreiSva,2021-05-07T21:10:02Z,vim and neovim are co-existing just fine.
834782700,835,nikitalita,2021-05-07T21:11:06Z,"""we do not incorporate cross-site tracking, limiting the ability to identify the user by both google and yandex."" this is misleading. if information is sent to either of these websites along with your ip, it's identifiable, period. it is easily correlated with you via the gobs and gobs of data they already have on you (yandex more so if you're russian). this is what they're good at, this is their bread and butter. and people know this. i will never opt into telemetry with them as the service provider, and so will many, many, many other people who use this app, which will limit the usefulness of this. if you switched to to a self-hosted solution, i'd definitely feel more comfortable with it. i recognize the utility and usefulness of telemetry in designing helpful applications, but there are tremendous privacy concerns that come with it, and using google or yandex is a non-starter for a huge swath of your userbase."
834783205,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T21:12:01Z,"they are still not addressing the main points though: why are they collecting the data they chose, why didn't they include the community, and why do they think this is apropriate way of collecting information about their __community__ (not product) my poll which has now over 1400 responses shows that 50% of respndants don't support the idea of any tracking at all. [a link] yet no response on this matter from audacity or muse."
834784428,835,IGBC,2021-05-07T21:14:07Z,i think i should restate what i said directed at a developer earlier:
834785286,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T21:15:37Z,"exactly... this was less of an issue like this one, there was just a feeling that there needed to be a different direction for the development. libreoffice and openoffice are co-existing as well...but i'd guess the user base for ooorg is a lot smaller now."
834793721,835,immibis,2021-05-07T21:30:51Z,"you will note that in these cases, the main developers of the project moved to the fork."

834807190,835,SndChaser,2021-05-07T21:55:34Z,"in those cases that is true. but there are lots of other cases where the original developer left a project, and others took over by forking the project. my point was that the concept of forking a project due to disagreements over development trajectories is not unusual in the open source world. whether the original developers move over, or if the fork gains the same following as the original was not really the point... addressing the lack of understand of the person i was responding to was the point."

834834673,835,Amolith,2021-05-07T22:47:31Z,"with this pr, telemetry would only be included in the official releases built through the github ci system; linux distributions building audacity from source on their own infrastructure won't include the telemetry bit *at all*. this means the project wouldn't get *any* data from *any* linux user installing it through their package manager in the first place. on one hand, i'm glad that none of my personal data would get sent to google and yandex. on the other hand, i'm pretty sure that means they wouldn't get potentially useful information from a significant chunk of their users so the collected data is incomplete. ignoring the privacy concerns for a moment, this functionality just seems badly implemented in its current state."

835140299,835,jayaddison,2021-05-08T06:27:38Z,"a meta-concern: if lots of apps decide that telemetry is important (even if it is disabled by default, with informed consent, and limited to sharing genuinely relevant data), then users are not going to have the time to stay aware of what information they are sending, to whom, and how to disable the items that they no longer wish to share. this is similar to the situation that cookie consent banners have arrived in. many websites may follow the rules, but the overall effect is that users are overwhelmed and lack sufficient agency to be confident about how their data is used. a scalable solution for the user population might require something more like a system settings dialog, where users could select what kind of information they are comfortable sharing, with the ability to add exceptions for specific types of application and/or data brokers. providing the ability for users to accurately vote with their data that way would help to create a telemetry/analytics data market, and increase the value of user data, encouraging data providers and application authors to play by the rules and maintain trust. on a personal note: in the long term, i think some level of data sharing is beneficial for people. it's difficult to exist entirely as an island. but not everyone feels safe or ready to share - especially when it is in a digital, nebulous way that their senses cannot detect. so we should always offer no sharing of data -- real privacy -- as a default, while explaining and showing the benefits (and drawbacks) that others experience from participating."

835155079,835,polyjitter,2021-05-08T06:56:08Z,"i'm sorry you feel that way, but all software has ethical and moral ramifications. those creating and using floss software are going to be incredibly interested in being both ethical and moral in the software that is produced, since floss values are foundationally about software that is honest about itself and does as little harm as possible, while being open and available for all. closed source, third party analytics solutions do not fall within those goals and leave the door for plenty of abuse, not necessarily from the audacity developers, but from providing more compilable data for a megacorp entity that is known to use software unethically, providing data to governments and other corporations that might seek to do harm to marginalized people and communities. this is absolutely a justified conversation to be having, even though the toxicity in some places is rather unwelcomed and disappointing."

835423668,835,ghost,2021-05-08T16:39:28Z,"### public appeal **of ngo «ukrainian liberation»** **_dear representatives of: • free software foundation; • «muse group» company; • community of the «audacity» project; • free software community; • other concerned communities and organizations!_** --- our ngo is deeply concerned by the implementation of telemetry in the code of free audio software «audacity». in our opinion, such actions not only restricts anyone’s natural right to liberty, but it also threatens to split the «audacity»’s community. at the beginning of may of this year, several international media reported that free and open-source audio software «audacity» was bought by the «muse group» company on april 25th, 2021. [a link] is one of the articles as an example. around the same time, the following [a link] appeared on «github». the post was made by a user [a link], who, judging by the context, is a representative of the «muse group» company, aka new owners of the «audacity». in this post, mr. (or according to the information from the personal profile on «github», dmitrii viedienko, from saint-petersburg, russian federation), is justifying the implementation of telemetry. specialists from the pr department of the ngo «ukrainian liberation» analyzed the text of the post and found not only contradictions but also signs of manipulation, which, according to our ngo, were included. below you can find the results of our analysis of the crsib's post, which we received tonight from our pr specialists: it is important to note, that specialists from the pr department of the ngo «ukrainian liberation» do not claim their conclusions to be the only possible truth. they should be perceived taking into account that every person (or group of people united by one idea, like our ngo, for example) are entitled to their own opinion, even if it is not correct. but let’s go back to the initial issue. [a link] is a company that has representatives in hong kong, shanghai, and sydney, australia. you can also contact them via messengers, which are far from the free software (""wechat"" and ""weibo""). the author of the initial post on «github» under the nickname crsib is from russian federation, the «muse group» company is (as we might guess) from china. in our opinion, both of these countries can hardly be called completely free and democratic. we are doing our best to leave the political and territorial aspects out of this conversation, but here we are forced to dwell on this point. we sincerely apologize to the community for emphasizing this, but we believe that without a full and comprehensive understanding of the situation, it will be hard to understand the conclusion that we came to. moreover, [a link]. in our opinion, this partly explains the use of non-free platforms «yandex» (russia) and «google» to collect the data, as well as why there has been no previous discussion with the community. (by the way, we still are not fully sure, how (and from whom) the abovementioned «muse group» **bought a free and open project «audacity»**. we are asking the representatives to provide an explanation regarding this issue. this letter should also be considered as a request for relevant public information from the «muse group» company: **how and from whom is it possible to purchase a free and open project?**) all the above cannot help but cause significant concern about the future of «audacity» - an audio editor that we all know, love, and actively use. without resorting to any subjective analysis, we ask members of the community to pay attention to the history of activity of the user crsib on the «github». we deliberately do not draw any conclusions. this situation with the «audacity» brought another split in the community, all this despite the still-fresh memory of «the code of conduct» among linux kernel developers, and, as we see it, bullying of rms and fsf, which, in general, causes new conflicts in our community (ngo «ukrainian liberation» considers itself a part of the community, because we fully share its values and spread them at our home country, ukraine, as much as we are allowed to by current social, political, economic and other circumstances). ngo «ukrainian liberation» also expresses its deep concern at the reaction of individual users to this situation. everywhere we see proposals to create a fork of «audacity» based on the latest available version, free from telemetry. we believe that this measure is acceptable, but it is extreme (when all other solutions failed). it will inevitably deepen the division in the community, as such an approach has both active supporters and opponents. unfortunately, people often forget that the idea is more important than people and their personal opinions. we are convinced that the fork at this stage will lead to two parallel programs - free and imbued with telemetry - and then the «audacity» community will simply split in two, three, and so on. ngo «ukrainian liberation» believes that this is what supporters of non-free components in the software want. this will significantly weaken us. in our opinion, we still have a chance to save our favorite program. with this goal, we introduce the hashtag #saveaudacity. we would like to ask those who agree with our position and our concerns to spread the information about the situation with the «audacity» by using this (or any others, at the discretion of the community) hashtag. as an ngo, we see our main current task in spreading awareness and objective information that, unfortunately, is relevant to the «audacity» audio editor. we call on the community to understand our concerns and to help us. fsf community has always been strong in unity, but today we are divided over political, gender, racial, and all sorts of other stereotypes that do not apply and are not even related to the free software. some individuals believe that their opinion is more important than the idea of freedom and unity of community. with all due respect, we find this position destructive. we ask the community for help also because we do not have programmers among our volunteers, and we cannot conduct an audit of the «audacity» code for backdoors and vulnerabilities included (or not included). **please, help.** ----- _the entire text of this appeal is a purely subjective opinion about the situation from representatives of ngo «ukrainian liberation». this text does not claim to be an undeniable truth and objectivity. we deliberately do not draw any conclusions, leaving this prerogative to the community. without blaming anyone, we present our vision of a situation that might differ (and might be different) from objective reality. with this letter, we ask fsf to assess the situation with «audacity» and, if there is such legal possibility, start integrating ngo «ukrainian liberation» into the fsf as an associate member or any other form that will allow us to interact and fight together against modern challenges. we understood [a link] of rms perfectly and we strive to be useful. only together we can stand and fight against those who bring evil and discord. we are open to a conversation: ukrliberation.com. we will view letters in english, ukrainian, russian, and belarusian._ **_with sincere respect and with apologies for excessive emotionality —_** _**bohdan kovalchuk, chairman (No0) of the ngo «ukrainian liberation», as well as the entire team of this ngo.**_ ----- **original pdf file with a signature and a stamp of ngo ""ukrainian liberation"" [a link].** **translated from ukrainian by [dara sereda.](seredache2000.com)** ----- ### caution! **we were extremely mistaken with tagging the wrong ""muse group"" (thanks to polyjitter and others it had been noticed). i would like to also note, that words about location in china were not meant to hurt or upset anyone, as they had no intent to spread racial stereotypes. we were trying to make a comment about the non-free policies that the country leads. we won't change the initial text, as we fully acknowledge our mistake. thank you, attentive readers, who were able to catch inaccuracies in the text and help us fix them!

telemetry: - lack of stability information. - unknown userbase size. - development and support decisions. - resolving a known issue with unknown impact on users. in addition, the stated information that will be gathered via a telemetry interface are stated as: - application open information (yandex) - session start / end events (google) - debug information / errors (google) - file format information (google) - operating system version (google) - audacity version (google) - other tools used by the user (google) - ip address (google & yandex) the vast majority of this information, however does not need to be gathered using telemetry, and in fact, using telemetry would likely lead to mis-leading information or a lot of unusable information being gathered that would not assist the development process. before going into the reasons telemetry is not appropriate for addressing the majority of this information, consideration should be given to how telemetry is generally used in large open source projects. ## telemetry in open source there are projects that use telemetry. however, in many cases the implementation of telemetry is well documented, and frequently goes through an exhaustive approval process before being implemented. the following provides an overview of telemetry handling in several open source projects. ### case: the linux foundation **the linux foundation** introduced their [telemetry data collection and usage policy]([a link] in october of 2019. the policy makes it clear that there are many items that need to be considered before implementations are approved. these considerations include (but are not limited to): 1. individual data privacy: does the data track or identify the user? if it doesn't could it still include personal information that is subject to laws and regulations? 2. data confidentiality: does the data result in any business-sensitive information being sent to the project, or a third party? if there was a consent dialog, what guarantees that the user was authorized to grant consent? 3. awareness of collection: does the software guarantee that no data is gathered before consent has been given? is it opt-out or opt-in? can the consent notice be bypassed? 4. security of the collection mechanism: does the ""phone home"" mechanism itself open security vulnerabilities to the application? is there still a vulnerability if the user does not opt-in to the data gathering? in order to deal with all of this information, the linux foundation requires member applications submit to a review by providing: - the specific data to be collected. - demonstrate the data is fully anonymized, and does not contain any data about an end user, or information that could be sensitive. - the manner in which users are notified of the details of the data collection, use and distribution. meeting requirement of consent before information is gathered. - the manner in which the information is to be stored and use by the project. - security mechanisms used to ensure the collection of information will no result in unintentional collection, or security vulnerabilities. following all this guidance, the information is submitted to a review panel of the linux foundation's legal team for review. ### case: kde the kde project introduced telemetry into their plasma environment approximately a year ago. in so doing, they developed a [telemetry policy]([a link] that is applied to all applications in the kde environment. this is a rough summary of the policy: - transparency: - data is shared in a way that (a) is easy to understand, (b) is precise and complete, (c) is locally available without network connection. - any changes to the gather must be highlighted during the release announcement. - control: - telemetry is **always** opt-in. it is off by default, and only enabled by explicit user action. - telemetry settings can be changed at any time, and are prominent in the user interface of the application. - telemetry settings are independent of any other settings, features or functionality. - applications must honor system-wide telemetry settings. - detailed documentation must be provided on the operation of the telemetry settings. - anonymity: - nothing that is considered personal information is gathered, especially where regulations such as the gdpr are concerned. - no unique devices, installation or user id's are used. - data is stripped of any unnecessary details, and downsampled appropriately before transmission. - network operation data (such as ip addresses) are not stored with the telemetry data. - minimalism: - only gather the absolutely minimal information needed. - collected data must have a clear purpose. - data is downsampled to the maximum extent possible before transmission. - relevant correlations between individuals bit of data should be computed at the source whenever possible. - data collection is stopped when corresponding questions have been answered. - privacy: - never transmit any user content, or hints at user content (ie, file names, url's, etc.) - gather only system information specific to the installation / environment **independent** of how the application/machine/installation is used. - gather statistical usage data of an installation / application. in order to use telemetry information in a kde project, all of the above must be met, and a public review is passed. this review process is repeated for every release if there are any changes to the information being gathered. received data is regularly audited for violations of this policy. if there is a violation, the data is deleted and collection is suspended until compliance can be re-established. to date, only [four kde applications]([a link] use telemetry data. ### case: gitlab on october 23rd of 2019 gitlab announced that they were making [changes to their terms of service]([a link] that included the addition of javascript on their website that would gather information to be used by gitlab and possibly sent to third parties. the code would be both open source and proprietary. they stated that they would update their privacy policy to indicate what information was being gathered, and where it was being sent. users of gitlab immediately took to the issue that was opened to track the announcement and wrote a number of messages of concern about the information that was being gathered, and the lack of control about how the information was being used. on october 29th, gitlab sent out a letter that explained the following: ### other cases in an earlier post i documented the policies, processes and information gathered by firefox, including the glean tool the mozilla foundation specifically created for gathering this information. something that wasn't discussed as a significant point was firefox's transparency and user's control in terms of their telemetry gathering. any user can see what information has been sent to mozilla without having to dig through their telemetry portal. just open ""about:telemetry"", and the last two weeks of pings is available for users to see and verify that none of the information being sent to mozilla is sensitive. also users have a degree of control over what information is being gathered through a series of check boxes available in the privacy & security portion of the preferences menu. * * * also contained in the comments on this pr is a discussion with one of the main developers of ardour, in which we discuss the information that they gather, and the limited usefulness of this information, and the processes and decision making that went into adding it to ardour. ### telemetry conclusion when implemented properly in large projects, there is far more consideration given to the process and procedures needed to make certain that appropriate safeguards are implemented to protect end user's privacy and anonymity. further, the consideration for safeguarding against sensitive information being communicated is also required. on top of this, legal and / or public review of telemetry information being gathered is a routine process in these projects. when the input of the community is not considered, problems such as that issues that gitlab created for themselves do serious damage to their perception in the community. ## data collection in open source there is actually a long history of data collection in open source projects. where data collection differs from telemetry is often in the frequency and / or the amount of detailed information that is gathered. ### os hardware profiles ubuntu, several of the \*bsd distributions, and others have been building hardware profile databases for years. this is typically done as a one-time, completely voluntary data collection performed during the operating system installation. an example of this is the [nyc\*bug dmesgd]([a link] which has allowed users to upload copies of their dmesg logs into a database since 2004. all of the information contained in the database is anonymized, there is no personally identifying information. system76 and redhat enterprise linux take a different approach. they include tools that are used only on the basis of support needs. these tools gather system logs, hardware profiles, detailed configuration information and system coredumps into a single file. this file is then attached to support requests through a secured system. ubuntu has made one of the more controversial implementations of data collection via it's ubuntu report tool. it gathers system information and sends reports to ubuntu including: ubuntu version, oem/manufacturer, device model number, bios info, cpu details, gpu details, installed ram, partition info, display(s) details, auto-login status, live patching status, desktop environment, display server, and timezone. while not containing direct personally identifying information, some of the information could be sensitive in a number of environments. the user is prompted during installation to disable (opt-out) of the data collection, and is allowed to preview the data before it is sent, while making the decision. the data gathering system is a standalone package that can be completely removed from the system in environments where having installed would be deemed an issue. ### application crash reporting numerous systems, including ubuntu, redhat enterprise linux, and others have features that can be enabled to allow semi-automated submission for crash reports with debug information. this allows targeted collection of information which the user likely feels more comfortable in submitting the information. additionally, this can be used much in the same way as the system76 and redhat tools for generating logs and debug information that the user can submit as part of a support request. ### software popularity ubuntu, debian, arch linux, and other distributions contain a package which is not installed or enabled by default that allow users to send information about the applications they are using on their system. the information is restricted to: package name, how recently it has been used, and how recently it has been updated. this approach keeps to the approach of sending minimal information, devoid of personally identifying information. since this software is not activated unless specifically installed by the end user or system administrator, there is a fairly high confidence that potentially sensitive information is not being communicated. ### data collection conclusion there is a long standing tradition of data collection when it comes to the open source world. however, many linux distributions have taken a stance of data gathering on an ""as needed"" basis (with the notable exception of ubuntu). systems like \*bsd's nyc\*bug are completely voluntary, and users specifically take the time to upload log files by their own choice. tools like those provided by redhat enterprise linux and system76 are specifically designed to be used in tracing problems and resolving issues. they are only used at the discretion of the end user or system administrator who is seeking support. popularity polling is a system that has been made available in several distributions, however it is typically not installed by default. instead users that are willing to share information about their usage habits may install and enable this functionality. the only notable substantial outlier (at lest that i know of) with regards to data collection is ubuntu, which installs a default collection system. this system, however, allows the user to opt-out on the first boot of their system after installation. it also offers the user the chance to actually see the information that is gathered to be sent to canonical before it is sent. ## audacity's telemetry justification this brings us back to the proclaimed need for telemtry in audacity. first let's look at the reasons: ### lack of stability information it's difficult to see how telemetry information as proposed would be able to affect this without gathering a lot of information about the environment in which the user is operating their system. the declared ""os"" information would certainly be more than just the os version? it would be necessary to know a lot of information about the underlying hardware configuration. gathering such detailed information (such as system board, cpu, firmware version, disk configuration, ram, etc.) could be considered by many users to be sensitive information. a better indicator for stability issues would be to have a reporting system that allowed users to submit reports when instability actually occurs. this targets the information to specific issues, instead of having an overly broad collection of information that makes the location of this information like finding a needle in a haystack. ### unknown userbase size this is probably one of the least worthwhile arguments put forward for the addition of telemetry information. the problem with this justification is that the implementation of telemetry collection is broken by design. this is a feature that the user has the choice to disable by default. that alone guarantees a level of inaccuracy of the information being gathered. to make matters worse, there is the option to compile the application without enabling telemetry at all. in this situation the information gathered by telemetry is very likely to be highly inaccurate. it will never be clear which linux distributions disable telemetry during package builds. it will never be clear what percentage of the user base opt's out of the telemetry when they are offered the option. there are much better ways to gather this information. as noted in the **software popularity** section, many linux distributions already collect anonymized information regarding package installation and usage. this information is often freely available from the distributions. outside of the linux ecosystem many of the distribution points for packages (including, i would believe) github and audacity's own websites keep download statistics for the package. many of these sites also gather client platform information during the download process. overall these sources of information would paint a more accurate picture than relying on the automated gathering of information with unknown levels of accuracy. ### development and support decisions. development and support decisions that are based on potentially highly flawed statistics from telemetry gathering (as outlined in **unknown userbase size**) will likely lead to bad decision making, and only serve to disenfranchise a portion of the current user base. directly polling the user base is a far better way to gather information about the direction to take for development. audacity has a support forum with over 150,000 users, and several mailing lists with a high number of users. certainly users that are so invested in the software to take the time to sign up for a forum, or add their email address to an email list are the users that should be targeted for development decisions. other ways of gathering information could be open, public, anonymous polls operated from audacity's website. ### resolving a known issue with unknown impact on users. this is a situation where it is difficult to understand how this information could be used in resolving an issue. first, it is something that really shouldn't be the basis for making a decision on whether to resolve an issue or not. the primary motivation for resolving an issue should be whether or not there is a security assessment. any features that is not working as designed needs to be assessed in the light of potential risk to the stability of a users system. this is first and foremost. the higher the chance that a issue can be exploited by any potential bad actor the higher the need to fix the issue. basing the decision to resolve an issue on the basis of user impact is the wrong way to go about supporting an issue. user impact should be considered to be equal to a threat assessment when users report the issue, and document the severity as having a significant impact on the user base. ## the proposed telemetry implementation as stated earlier, the proposed implementation of telemetry in audacity is highly problematic. but the nature of the problems with the chosen path here are much deeper. ### inaccurate information as stated above, the information being gathered is very likely to be highly inaccurate due to numerous factors. the number of users that will opt-out of telemetry will never be known. the number of downloads that have been built with the telemetry completely disabled will never be known. because of these fundamental flaws, the data should be considered gigo (garbage in, garbage out). ### lack of policy information no consideration, or research appears to have been done to develop a privacy policy that can be applied to telemetry information. large open source projects like **the linux foundation**, **kde**, and **firefox** have developed processes for the approval of telemetry implementation that involve legal and public review before any implementation is made. there is no process proposed by the audacity team to ensure that the information being gathered conforms to any regulatory requirements. ### choice of third party service providers many security and privacy experts warn of using google and yandex's systems. these systems are known to be used for extensive data mining. the implementation of these systems gather personally identifiable information (at a minimum ip addresses) through audacity is not an acceptable standard. ### the lack of consideration of open source alternatives at a minimum there are three open source alternatives that should be considered for the implementation of a telemetry system. the three that are known at this time are [a link], [a link] and [a link] all of these options are open source licensed tools, and have statements of gdpr compliance. several of them also cover ccpa and pecr compliance as well. ## conclusion this document has attempted to do the kind of research that the audacity team should have done before beginning work on implementing telemetry in audacity. this research has included: - looking at successful telemetry implementations in large open source projects - looking at a case where a large open source project went wrong with changes to their telemetry implementation - looking at alternative data collection techniques that could be implemented to largely the same effect as the proposed telemetry implementation - looking at the deep flaws in the proposed telemetry implementation - looking at the lack of communication around the proposed telemetry implementation - looking at alternative choices for implementing a telemetry system that would be more respectful of user privacy - looking at alternatives for gathering some of the information outside of using telemetry because of of all of the concerns outlined in this document, it is proposed that the implementation of telemetry in audacity be set aside until a more thorough investigation and discussion can take place that will address many of the issues raised in this document. this document was researched and written in under 12 hours. the audacity team should recognize that just the amount of issues brought up with a very short review dictates that there are issues that need a lot more research in order to be properly and thoroughly addressed."

835690489,835,jxu,2021-05-09T05:21:55Z,my speculation is that an open source project can be taken over by paying off or sneaking into contributor positions. intel and nsa have tried multiple times to push out old leadership and sneak in vulnerabilities into linux.
835691210,835,orenwatson,2021-05-09T05:24:29Z,i have been given confirmation from dominic mazzoni (by email) that he did indeed sell the trademark. the 4 month gap has not been explained however.

835772456,835,domsson,2021-05-09T10:06:24Z,"it is important for the people pushing for this feature to realize that the backlash they are getting is not just due to the implementation details or ""tinfoil hats"" being against telemetry out of principle. the context matters. audacity was very recently ""acquired"" by muse group, a company that was just recently founded itself. however, neither the [a link], nor the [a link], nor [a link] properly explain how that was done or what that even means. there is hardly any information on who is behind muse group. the [a link] currently seems quite fishy and also does not give any details. when a free, open source project that has existed for about 20 years is suddenly, and without any explanation, taken over by a company, that is reason for concern in itself. a community developed free and open source project does not have any financial interests, so the intention is simply in creating the _best_ software possible. a company naturally has to put financial interests first, so the focus _will_ shift to create the most _profitable_ software, not necessarily the _best_ software. with this, there comes the danger of paid-for features, monetizing of user data, dropping of cross-platform compatibility and many other worrying issues for the existing user base. hence, muse group should be very aware of the fact that people will watch closely as to what changes they are pushing for. with this context in mind, it should be clear that a pull request with 5500+ lines of new code and dependencies, which came out of the blue, without any prior consultation with the community, from a developer who is obviously associated with muse group, but has previously not contributed to the project, is reason for concern. however, if the pull request was a long sought-after feature, that would probably be okay. that is not the case, however. instead, this pull request implements a feature that not only _no one_ has ever asked for, but it is also one that has serious negative legal and moral implications. not only because it is about tracking user's data, but also because it attempts to do so in an atrocious way. add on top that the positive benefits of this are, at best, questionable, while the potential issues are huge. to name just a few, more code means more potential bugs and security vulnerabilities, more need for qa, bug fixing and maintenance, bigger download size, harder packaging for linux distributions and many more. therefore, this is not just about whether or not someone agrees to the collection of usage data. this is about a questionable over-take of an open-source project, about horrible decisions and timing, horrible implementation and horrible communication all bundled up into one huge disaster. even if this pull request will not be merged due to the pressure of the community, the trust in muse group and the future of the audacity project has already sustained damage that most likely can not be repaired. if you want to fix this, don't just replace google with matomo. if you want to fix this, don't just remove this pull request. if you want to fix this, you need to answer _a lot_ of questions and expose the motivations and details behind the overtake, this feature and many more. you owe it to a project that has been successful for twenty years. you owe it to a loyal and hard-working community. you owe it to us. you owe it to yourself."

835790791,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T11:52:27Z,"here is yet another point against adding any networking capabilities to audacity whatsoever. audacity uses a vendored copy of ffmpeg. as documented in issue #398, audacity was using ffmpeg version 2.2.2 until pull request #741 was merged only 4 days ago. ffmpeg 2.2.2 was [a link]. remember that [a link] by the lead developer of signal demonstrating a proof-of-concept exploit in widely used software? it strongly implied that was accomplished by exploiting a vulnerability in an old version of ffmpeg from 2012, likely with a specially formatted media file. that was exploited to achieve execution of arbitrary code by the attacker. considering audacity is an extremely widely used application, there would be a lot of incentive for a malicious actor to use it to launch an attack on audacity users' computers. the audacity maintainers (not merely the new people from muse group) have already demonstrated they are not trustworthy for maintaining the security of audacity. adding a novel attack surface, especially in a very reckless way by vendoring libcurl, is a horrible idea."
835793044,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T12:05:01Z,no new dependencies should be added to audacity before cleaning up this mess with vendored dependencies. this should be the very top priority above any new features or ux improvements because it is crucial for security.
835793562,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T12:07:42Z,"security does not pay bills and does not make for flashy news. so it ends up ignored most of the time, until a leak of some sorts happen. this is a systemic problem."
835794008,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T12:10:08Z,"speaking of signal, do you think it uses telemetry? is it unusable crap? (please don't take this off topic debating the merits of signal versus other messaging systems. that's not the point here.)"
835794267,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T12:11:26Z,"wtf has that to do with anything, or relevant at all? you are part of the problem here, please shut up"
835796555,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T12:23:48Z,i apologize for bringing that last point up. it's not very relevant. please don't respond to it and drag this off topic.
835814939,835,zearp,2021-05-09T14:08:58Z,when will a decision be made about this pr? i'm very curious how the maintainers weight the over 3000 thumbs down this pr has received.
835815593,835,ghost,2021-05-09T14:12:46Z,if you have the monitor upside down you could see it as over 3000 thumbs up for something you can't understand.
835827377,835,jg777,2021-05-09T15:19:55Z,"wow, the users are asking you not to do this and none of the audacity team seems to care about its users, so now you're going to go through with it?"
835828070,835,turtlegarden,2021-05-09T15:24:26Z,"to muse group: people are ready to maintain fork of audacity if this pr‌ gets accepted. most of your users do _not_ want telemetry either! therefore, if this pr gets accepted, _your investment in audacity would be near useless_. that's all."
835829214,835,turtlegarden,2021-05-09T15:31:08Z,"a lovely thing about oss: there are things called _forks_ which branch off the original project! many people do this when the original project goes awry (such as libreoffice and mate, forks of openoffice.org and gnome 2). this project is close to going haywire and _**many**_ people stated that they **will** fork and maintain audacity if this pr gets accepted. so, if you want to maintain a large user base, muse group, close this pr and you won't become openoffice.org soon."
835844840,835,marcopavanello,2021-05-09T17:04:52Z,"they are now probably thinking about ways to get around this telemetry thing and implement something else that satisfies their business model needs. they clearly showed us their mentality regarding not caring about people and ultimately, about the community. mentalities like that are hard to change, they are generally toxic. it's obvious that we as users who care about privacy need alternatives to edit our whale, monkey, voice and other personal recordings. so also if they won't commit this patch, i've had enough about their disrespectful and not engaging behavior towards humans. **get this shit that has nothing to do with an audio program out of here**."
835845422,835,jpellegrini,2021-05-09T17:08:18Z,"i'd guess it's more like ""trying to assess the impact of a fork, and how likely it would be that it happens"", and ""what plan b would be like if it happens"". i don' trust that they'll do anything good (kind of pessimistic, but anyway...) and i'm ready to start using a fork. i only remember one case in which a company reverted a decision to include telemetry in free software -- gitlab."
835850652,835,jg777,2021-05-09T17:39:43Z,"audacity is music software, which does not need or require a network stack. audacity is not a web browser, which does need and require a network stack."
835859628,835,DaVince,2021-05-09T18:32:21Z,"i keep seeing this argument but the simple truth is: * this pull request is a draft, not some guaranteed merge action. * the developers taking their time to think about the best course of action from here on out. not immediately responding to the dogpiling that's going on in this pr, shouldn't be misconstrued as ""they don't care"", especially considering how helpful the community at large has been (speaking as a lurker). afaik, some of the people involved in this pr actually read every single post here, and are evaluating how to tackle the telemetry issue in a way that would work out for both the devs and the users."
835859697,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T18:32:47Z,"i just got banned off of the audacity discord. not for being rude, pushy, or invasive - but for pointing out that their ""good luck finding people to maintain a fork"" comments were a little strange and disconcerting. i really, _really_ wanted to assume negligence instead of malintent, and tried to have an open conversation with the maintainers. i was met with rudeness, snyde comments, pompous behavior (""good luck, you can't just take over a 20 year project so easily"", ""good luck finding translators"", etc.). # the devs have no interest in listening to anyone. let's fork it already."
835860346,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T18:36:31Z,"it was not a draft when it was posted. it was converted to one after the initial backlash. this was also requested directly by tantacrul, the new owner of audacity, and coded/submitted by a muse group employee. they have every intent to merge this."
835860713,835,ghost,2021-05-09T18:38:51Z,- did they really say that? there's not even a need to maintain any fork - all it takes to disable telemetry is to build audacity from source and distribute the clean binaries.
835862558,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T18:50:07Z,"yes. it's not paraphrasing, either."
835863881,835,DaVince,2021-05-09T18:57:53Z,"if they had every intent, it would not have been reverted to a draft. don't think they're not taking this seriously."
835864192,835,turtlegarden,2021-05-09T18:59:33Z,"this is true, however more antifeatures will _likely_ be added (and in that case, fork time!)."
835864444,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T19:01:05Z,they are not taking it seriously. tantacrul said in the discord that he's waiting for this to blow over.
835865019,835,DaVince,2021-05-09T19:04:08Z,"how is that any indication of them not taking it seriously? that's a wise course of action when you're being dogpiled on. meanwhile, it creates some space to rethink how to tackle the feature instead. i feel like i'm contributing too many posts to this way-too-long pr already, and i'm not sure it's going anywhere, so i'm pulling out of this conversation. but maybe keep a basic modicum of trust that the people who have been working on this project for years are out to find the right solution that works for everyone."
835865078,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T19:04:24Z,i'm reading the reversion to a draft state as more of wip cycle as coding errors / issues are worked out. i am not seeing this as the intent to revert the code completely and close out this pr.
835865271,835,xTibor,2021-05-09T19:05:43Z,apart from the legal/privacy/ethical issues what concerns me the most they are giving zero response to the technical concerns raised in the code reviews. that alone convinces me to support whatever popular non-muse fork emerges.
835865636,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T19:07:36Z,"that's exactly what i did, and they gave me every reason to believe this is not some innocent ordeal."
835866087,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T19:09:59Z,"the only way to ""...find the right solution..."" would be to start from scratch. the code that is being worked on is flawed from it's initial intent, and is broken by design. those are issues that cannot be coded around."
835866165,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T19:10:34Z,that trust has already been broken for many. it is up to the maintainers (old and new) to work towards restoring it. i have suggested multiple times throughout this discussion specific steps they could take to build trust. i am awfully concerned that they have not taken any of those steps in days. the most basic step would be a simple comment saying that they commit to not using google analytics nor yandex. all that takes is one sentence. and that's just the first step to demonstrate this is going in the right direction.
835868839,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T19:24:24Z,"this is a bad idea. this will not blow over until a response is provided. if it is a bad response, it will blow up even bigger."
835871371,835,jg777,2021-05-09T19:37:47Z,"again, for those that aren't ""developers"", in software development you don't add code that is not necessary to the main functionality of the application. this pr is attempting to turn a really great and working perfectly fine right now ""audio application"" into a ""web browser"" (with who knows what down the road and a bunch of **new security issues as it using your network**) currently this software does not use the network or internet."
835871928,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T19:40:34Z,"can you post a screenshot of this please? i disagree with discord tos, so i cannot join."
835872687,835,orenwatson,2021-05-09T19:45:04Z,"tantacrul must have said that after he kicked me from his discord, as i did not see it."
835872750,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T19:45:24Z,"nope. i was banned. i know for a fact some others in this thread are in there and can post some screenshots, however (assuming they haven't also been banned). i won't tag them so as to not 'out' them to the hostile audacity team. i encourage them to copy the logs and take screenshots, though. conversations in there would be very interesting to the people here, and i don't want to be the one shouting out hearsay."
835872940,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T19:46:27Z,"adding network features does not mean making it a browser. browsers nowadays are a full os, with not just networking, font and image rendering, but also audio and video playback, camera and usb access, gps and others sensors, p2p communication, screensharing... errr what else, whatever the main pc can do, the browser will likely do it too (maybe not now, but in due time for sure)"
835873323,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T19:48:29Z,"nevermind, i forgot i took a screenshot of an older conversation yesterday that had (some of) the relevant bits. # edit: they are trying to censor this. please don't let them. ![a link] --- here is what was edited into this comment. conversation cannot be copyrighted, and everyone knows who each of the un-censored people are as they are maintainers of this project and/or celebrities (in the case of tantacrul). i protected the non-maintainers who were trying to raise concern with you and have a conversation before you banned us, because they are _not_ well known people and _not_ celebrities. i've not revealed anything other than your intent - much less private information. those named on there do not even give your discord ids, in which you need the nonce number in order to contact anyway. don't be dumb."
835873845,835,domsson,2021-05-09T19:51:00Z,"first, if it is true that they are really waiting for this to ""blow over"", then i think it is likely that they will eventually close this pr for further comments. we should probably agree on an alternative place to keep the conversation going pretty soon, so that killing the conversation here will not kill the conversation in general. second, can someone link to the mentioned discord? i could not find an audacity discord or a mention of such anywhere."
835873873,835,orenwatson,2021-05-09T19:51:08Z,"also, at this point it would be wise for us to create our own discord or channel for communication, as this pr's comment section is of course subject to being potentially deleted by muse group."
835873926,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T19:51:22Z,"thanks! though that is a bit unclear/dubious about intentions. letting things cool down is always a good thing, dont make decisions or say things under pressure. we should still press them for a proper response to all of this though. their community deserves better than this"
835874066,835,orenwatson,2021-05-09T19:52:08Z,"perhaps an irc channel on say freenode, rather than a discord?"
835874142,835,jxu,2021-05-09T19:52:40Z,is it possible to archive all comments in this pr? a lot of useless comments (admittedly i contributed a few) but some very good ones as well
835874177,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T19:52:52Z,"#audacity already exists, we can use that?"
835874381,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T19:53:58Z,"yes, of course. all i can say is, it's clear (to me) based on the _rest_ of the very long conversation that took place in there (aside from that screenshot) that they aren't doing it as a ""cooldown"" period. they're actively hiding from the problem and waiting for things to quiet down enough to move forward. this was also clear to me as the development discussion about this pr was still taking place in the development channels by both the op as well as the rest of the maintainers, talking about changes being made to the code in order to merge it later. yes, sort of. [a link]"
835875942,835,jrmoore,2021-05-09T20:02:09Z,"i'd like to give my two cents on the matter, being an audacity user but also a software engineer. i don't think telemetry per se is a bad thing, for me it wildly depends on how it's done and what for. there are always cases of abuse, whether it be overreaching forcing it on people without an option to opt-out (e.g., the way microsoft does it with windows 10 for example) or the myriad of trackers many websites employ to track users actions so advertisers can target them better (where the worse possible outcome would be a price hike on something because they'd know that particular user would buy it because it's important for them). but, when used for the betterment of the product itself it's something really useful and metrics of all kinds are present in all phases of software development, even during prototyping. i'm going to simplify things, but lets say you have two low fidelity prototypes for a new program, you present them to a series of (willing) participants and see how they use them, how long it takes them to accomplish tasks, what their opinions are, there's a whole lot of things that can be measured there already! afterwards you get to see how they did, which was more effective, more efficient, more intuitive, etc. this is as old as 1986, when john brooke created his system usability scale thing. then there'd be high level prototypes, more interviews, different kinds of metrics, etc. all of that before an actual app is even done! obviously not everybody does things that way, and i'm kind of going off track, but i wanted to let you all know that metrics can be useful towards creating a good program. the thing is, how would you translate that to a finished product already? or an ongoing one? obviously forcing participation is not the way to go (imagine someone approaching you in the street making you use their prototype or else), and doing it surreptitiously is even worse. so in my eyes, whatever is done (generally speaking, not talking about audacity concretely), should be done with the consent of the users and ideally be an opt-in situation. from what i read over at 's original post it would be opt-in and disabled by default, so if that's the case so far so good for me. now, what to track actually? because that's a slippery slope, broadly speaking you'd want to keep it to a minimum, but tracking things that would be important for the betterment of the app itself. to my mind comes microsoft again, any of you remember the changes office had throughout its versions? the amount of toolbars it used to have and how things changed with office 2007? (that's when the ribbon was introduced, which has come a long way since then too, but that's another matter). they had an enormous amount of data from real users, already prior to introducing the ribbon, but i mention it because i remember seeing a presentation on what led to the creation of the ribbon (mix08 it was, i think there are videos in youtube for those willing to see it and i'd highly recommend them even if they're dated) and all that data was really useful! they allowed them to know which functions where used more, which weren't used at all, which where so hidden people didn't even know about (think about it, what do we use in an office suite and what is it capable of doing haha). all that came from telemetry, same with how many steps it took to do something and waaaaay more things (i'd say they captured way too much, but that's not the general point i'm trying to make). being able to see that your users use a function a lot, but it's hidden under several clics may make you think ""okay, let's see if we can make it more accessible, more intuitive"". or maybe, ""wow, they're really using that function and we're even working on it that much, let's do some sprints on it and see how we could improve it"". or even, ""oh... many users are making that mistake before accomplishing what they wanted to do, should we do something about it?"" (because you could see correlation of actions too, where you click at one moment and where you click next). it's another tangent, but in my experience the first thing that comes to my mind is the ""exporting"" to png for example in gimp, i'd go to ""save"" or ""save as"" instead many times. after all that i've said, my position on telemetry would be good, i like things i use the most to be priorized over others maybe. besides, audacity being open source, we (or those with knowledge and inclination) can know what's being measured so we don't have to trust it's going to be something when it's not. yes, it's a big pull request, and it's just that, a request open for comments one way or another and i'm sure the whole thing would be refined before shipping it in a subsequent release (if it's integrated that is). plus, if it's off by default there's nothing to worry about in my mind for those who don't want to take part into shaping the next versions. and if it ended up overreaching or whatever there would also be the possibility of building some binaries without the telemetry code (e.g., if using google's and/or yandex's systems is unacceptable). the bottom line is, just don't think of metrics as a bad thing, at least acknowledge they can be used for good too. yes, many times they're used for not so amicable things like those examples i wrote at the beginning, but not always. and while doing surveys like i mentioned is also another possibility, it isn't as representative of the real usage and certainly not as informative for developers. as long as audacity remains open source and the focus is to improve its usability, user experience, interface, etc. i'm good for it. ps. sorry for the long text, i started writing and it ended up being massive."

835882492,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T20:34:32Z,"still need to check and investigate the ci build. in any case keep an eye on [a link] and i will be announcing it there when there is something to see. i had forked for my personal gh account, but it is better to use [a link] the main question now is if it is possible to keep the audacity name as-is (because the build will be identical, as-is, just with no tracking). as much as muse group want to be good people, i think that might be crossing a line on my side. is it okay to keep audacity name for builds which are identical in every way except tracking completely disabled?"
835883452,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T20:38:40Z,"you'll probably need to change the name. audacity is [a link], and as someone else in the discord (not mentioning who) pointed out, ""audacity"" is trademarked. that trademark changed ownership sometime last year and they took 4 months to announce it. the deal of the trademark transfer was not really outlined per my knowledge. perhaps you don't 'need' to, but you certainly want to - especially since muse group doesn't seem to be cooperative with the oss community."

835891369,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T21:13:34Z,"i want to reiterate my concern for how the decision to even start working on this was made and how this pull request has been handled. it is *not* normal for foss projects to have no public discussion of major changes to the code before any code is written. if you do not make significant changes to your decision making process, including how the roadmap for development is decided, you should anticipate more contentious pull requests like this. again, i strongly recommend that every audacity maintainer, old and new, read all three of these blog posts about the rust community's growth through a highly contentious issue: [a link] [a link] [a link] furthermore i want to reiterate my earlier suggestion to enable telemetry/tracking only in special builds made for enthusiastic testers who specifically want to provide this data to assist in the development of audacity. mentioned this idea in his [a link] about this as well. i think these users would accept much more invasive data gathering for these special builds than average users, which could help you get better information to improve audacity. you could also likely get linux users to participate in this."
835897075,835,domsson,2021-05-09T21:35:47Z,"this is rather frustrating. while it is appreciated that the pr has finally been closed, your take-away is worrying. the vast majority of comments here has made it clear that tracking and the code bloat that comes with it is neither needed nor wanted. but you're basically saying outright that you will have another stab at this. what you _should_ take on board instead: - no tracking, full stop - no huge pr without any prior discussion - no features that no one has ever asked for - no unnecessary code bloat"
835897610,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T21:37:57Z,"yes, i think there might be a better way to move forward and make a tool that could accomplish the audacity team's goals without infringing on other's privacy. my thought is what if instead of being built into the application directly, there was an extension system. the extension system could allow the user to install things like a ""support tool"" that only provides crash reporting / debug info. a ""feedback tool"" could provide more usage based information. a ""cloud export tool"" could enable users to be able to send files to whatever cloud based storage they wanted. (this last item is something that steve daulton mentioned being requested by users before.) the idea is that having this kind of system would keep this code off users systems unless they **specifically** decided to download and install it. of course, this doesn't directly address the infrastructure side of things...that is another issue that needs to be worked on."
835898440,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T21:41:27Z,extensions add complexity. it is an annoying maintenance burden to keep api/abi compatibility between the host application and externally maintained/installed extensions. i suggest using compile options with cmake instead.
835900157,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T21:48:57Z,"-ing it does add complexity, however it has many advantages: 1. there's no lock-in on platforms where users generally don't build the code on their own (ie, mac and windows) 2. it doesn't require access to github to submit new extensions 3. it puts more control over the code that's installed on their system in the user's hands. 3. a marketplace type system could take some pressure off the developers to chase after features that they don't feel should be in the audacity core 4. it could provide muse group / others with a way to provide ""value added"" add-ons"
835900576,835,polyjitter,2021-05-09T21:50:46Z,"crash reports are indeed a form of analytics and telemetry, so i hope everyone fighting against any form of analytics and telemetry are willing to debug based on hearsay..."
835901489,835,falkTX,2021-05-09T21:54:31Z,"you can use coredumps for when an application crashes and save them locally. it is then up to the user to upload those, or not. users can have a choice if we give it to them."
835903339,835,Martin-Eckleben,2021-05-09T22:01:40Z,mentioned this on a twitter post from a linux mag asking tantacrul to give an interview. got blocked. ![a link]
835904332,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T22:05:34Z,"that's why i like the idea of an extension system...it gives the user the choice... kind of the ultimate ""opt-in"" - it doesn't exist until the user adds it... if they decide they don't want it, they remove it."
835904630,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T22:06:37Z,"why did you ban users from your official discord when they were trying to have a conversation with the maintainers? i'm seeing a pattern here. --- ![a link] you should probably not speak this way to an army of people who are upset with you for violating their privacy. good thing github edits are public, though. edit: he deleted the comment, lol.

835905166,835,Martin-Eckleben,2021-05-09T22:08:31Z,i posted two comments. not like i spewed conspiracy theory or spammed.

835909694,835,Be-ing,2021-05-09T22:23:32Z,i opened a new issue to discuss how to clean up audacity's dependency management: #853. i think everything that needs to be said about this issue has been said already. i suggest locking the discussion now.
835910537,835,Qix-,2021-05-09T22:25:54Z,-ing consider x-posting to the fork. [a link] edit: issues aren't enabled yet actually - can you fix that?
835911713,835,SndChaser,2021-05-09T22:29:35Z,everyone needs to back down. this pr is closed. it's back to the drawing board to see where things go... muse group now have a chance to address the concerns that have been brought up in this pr. there is no reason to target anyone on the dev team.
835913219,835,efeklisov,2021-05-09T22:34:06Z,"i’d even say tantacrucial! (sorry) on a serious note, i also think that telemetry should be implemented as an optional plugin or available only in a separate build for enthusiasts. matters like supporting old osx systems can be resolved with a poll."
835917857,835,BitesizedLion,2021-05-09T22:46:54Z,"this whole ""muse group"" situation is really sketchy in my opinion."
835921181,835,zearp,2021-05-09T22:54:25Z,i'm glad the maintainers have closed this for now. i do hope they come to their senses and abandon this idea completely. there is no need for tracking or a network stack in an audio editor.
835923381,835,Tantacrul,2021-05-09T22:59:02Z,"incidentally, i'm doing what i can to make sure each of the community's requests are being heard but bear in mind that although i may be heading up the design and prioritisation of features, i'm not all-powerful and the solutions are not in my gift to give. that goes for the creator of this pr too. best i can do is try to push for an outcome that will please as many people as possible."
835938323,835,geekredux,2021-05-09T23:29:42Z,"the pr votes and this comment thread seem to have made what that would be pretty clear. thanks for the follow-up. edit: , i will encourage you to clarify what your role on the audacity project is, though. your youtube announcement video title declares you to be ""in charge of audacity"", and your twitter bio says you are ""the head of musescore and audacity"". both suggest that if you decided there should not be telemetry or a network layer added to audacity, it would indeed be a gift you could give."
835959358,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T00:07:22Z,"where will this be published? the audacity forum (if so, in what category)? in a new github issue? one of the email lists?"
835979978,835,turtlegarden,2021-05-10T00:34:11Z,"this is closed, but this does _**not**_ mean that the muse group will not add telemetry. tantacrul requested telemetry in the muse group discord server (discord? foss? doesn't match at all!) so i do not believe they will give up."
835996960,835,eunakria,2021-05-10T00:56:15Z,"fwiw discord is super common even among foss communities. it has a lot of issues, including its nature, being so vehemently proprietary that they've even spoken against client modifications like betterdiscord that are based on the code of the official application, but hey, we're on github, which is also almost completely proprietary. discord's a really useful place to get friends together and build communities and communicate, whatever its nature in licensing, and it's a perfectly valid choice for people who want half-decent, sustainably scaling chat, so i think that picking on it is a little undue. that said, yeah, definitely needs to offer a statement of clarification on this. the whole situation feels more than a little uncomfortable."
836040128,835,orenwatson,2021-05-10T01:20:21Z,"i would also like a full explanation given ideally to the press, perhaps the register for example, of: - the origins of muse group, a for-profit corporation in cyprus - who really are their primary shareholders - how they bought the trademark ""audacity"" and - what happened between buying the trademark at end of dec 2020 and announcing this at april 2021."
836069326,835,Tantacrul,2021-05-10T02:10:54Z,"sure. i propose the roadmap and many of the features (with help from others on our team) and i work with the community who collaborate on these things in addition to their own goals. i've been doing the same thing for musescore for a while now. however, because i'm in charge of audacity and musescore, this does not mean that i run muse. i work for muse. regarding telemetry: this is a requirement that muse have for every app in their ecosystem so they can determine how the changes we make are performing. i did not (as someone said above) 'request' it. now that this telemetry thing has kicked off, i'm trying my best to achieve a resolution that annoys as few people as possible. then i want to get back to the roadmap so everyone can see what things we are planning and have the opportunity to comment on them. all i'm interested in is working on the design and feature set of audacity. someone else is asking why we only announced recently, having started in late november. answer is easy: transitions take time. a team needed to be hired. skills needed to be learned. we needed to get to know the community and we all had to do a lot of research. also... that announcement video took about a month to write and edit too. i know i'm not answering every question people have asked here. i feel it's best to first get to the telemetry announcement as fast as possible and take it from there. the announcement _should_ happen this week."
836074105,835,jxu,2021-05-10T02:19:14Z,"just because muse owns the name of audacity does not mean the community will have to automatically follow along, especially for self imposed nonsense like ""this is a requirement that muse have for every app in their ecosystem so they can determine how the changes we make are performing."" i hope distro maintainers make the right choice and patch out or use a fork getting rid of this nonsense."
836074340,835,bkimmett,2021-05-10T02:19:37Z,"and here we arrive at why all this got started: this was requested by muse group. however, it looks like muse group may have to come to understand that the community that uses audacity does not want this. perhaps they'll have to arrive at a compromise? or simply back down, in this case."
836079472,835,SndChaser,2021-05-10T02:27:53Z,"i tried earlier to make certain that the depth of this issue is understand from the perspective of the open source community by providing a set of cases. i'm afraid that document got buried in the landslide of comments on here. please have a read through the copy here: [a link] it's a long document, nearly 10 pages, and yet it really on scratches the surface of how divisive the topic of telemetry is in the open source community. i understand that muse group's primary applications so far have been on mobile platforms, and non-open source. the concept of how to work with the open source community at large is a very foreign concept (i am, in fact, surprised things didn't blow up this way with the musescore community). my best suggestion to the muse group is to slow things down... make small changes first, go through the backlog of issues, pr's and bugs.... tackle those first while doing research to understand how to tackle larger changes in a way that will work for the community at large."
836085393,835,Tantacrul,2021-05-10T02:37:02Z,"wow. thanks! i apologise but i did miss this. incidentally, there was some anger on the musescore forums too although we actually announced it upfront, which i feel came across as much more transparent. in this instance, a communication error led to a first-pass pr being made public which wrong-footed us all and prevented us from announcing it first to gauge reactions. it looked bad when it was discovered like it was."
836087112,835,geekredux,2021-05-10T02:39:48Z,"hoo-boy, that's not going to appease anyone at all. but thanks for the response, ."
836091284,835,SndChaser,2021-05-10T02:46:27Z,"no apology necessary, i figured it might have been buried, or i posted it when you were (possibly) sleeping. ;) yes, clear communication is always a good first step. imo - there will always be noise around a topic this controversial, it's something that really should be expected. that puts the onus on the proposers to really approach the topic with serious and deliberate forethought. that's something that didn't happen in this case."
836093515,835,asdf8dfafjk,2021-05-10T02:50:05Z,"while i'm sad that you have succumbed to the telemetry fud vocal-sheeple-crowd that would not get the best feature prioritised, i wonder if anyone has recommendations (on unrelated note) to allow only whitelisted apps to connect to the network?"
836105118,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T03:09:47Z,"i'll bring in a quote from [a link] (emphasis mine): there has been a lack of transparency about what exactly the motivations for introducing telemetry are. if you are open about what exactly you are trying to accomplish, and start the discussion there rather than starting with 5500 lines of code already written, we may be able to help you figure out a way to do it in a way that is acceptable to the community. the caveat is that if your goals are directly opposed to the community's interests, we'd have to go our separate ways. so let's start with identifying what are the goals that might be accomplished using telemetry. from there, we can discuss the least invasive way to do that. that's how you can build trust. you may be surprised how much you can learn with a more focused approach to collecting data. it may be easier to find the needles when the haystack isn't so big."
836109757,835,SndChaser,2021-05-10T03:17:14Z,"hopefully you are still lurking... an issue that really should be worked on before telemetry is even approached again is de-vendoring the libraries that are being included in audacity. this is actually a massive issue....even bigger than i realized until a few minutes ago. currently there are only three of the top 100 linux distributions shipping audacity 3.x (fedora, mageia and opensuse). there are literally 97 other distributions out there that are still shipping audacity 2.x (including: arch, debian, ubuntu, manjaro, and mint). even if telemetry had been added it would have been irrelevant in the linux world because the vast majority of the distributions can't ship the 3.x releases as they are because there are issues building it. the reason is because audacity is relying on specific libraries that they are bundling with the application, instead of working with the current releases of those libraries. this mistake was going to be made again in this pr by vendoring libcurl as part of the implementation for the network-manager layer. the likely reason this happened is because many of these libraries aren't natively part of windows and macos. so, the vendoring approach was taken in order to handle those platforms. the way to fix this isn't going to be easy... the approach that would likely be the best would be to (a) de-vendor the libraries, (b) modify the build system to produce flatpaks versions for macos and windows. this way the flatpaks can include the libraries (and the most current version of them), while linux versions can build against the native libraries. (at least this is my initial idea for fixing it -- others may have better ideas.)"
836112638,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T03:21:35Z,please take the discussion about devendoring dependencies to #853.
836117684,835,Qix-,2021-05-10T03:29:21Z,"not to stir the pot, but 's comment was posted directly in the audacity discord group within minutes of you interacting with the very same channel. going to be blunt: i don't believe you. i think you saw it and either chose not to read it, or you're trying to save face. of course nobody can read minds, so this is pure speculation. either way, none of this is sitting right with me. it really feels like muse is trying to save face here whilst still trying to keep ulterior motives under wraps. the trust is permanently gone."
836119092,835,orenwatson,2021-05-10T03:31:39Z,"i will emphasize that muse is in no position to ""require"" telemetry in a free software program, as all users are empowered to take and modify this software as we see fit, by the gnu gplv2. therefore, if we do not want telemetry, there will be no telemetry"
836122245,835,illwieckz,2021-05-10T03:36:31Z,"i'm not sure many people reacting there are knowing how github works. this is a pull request, and then, a draft. if the data was not as anonymous as the stated goal said, then what people must ask for the proposed draft to be rewritten, or submit proposed change to fix the issue. some people submitted suggestions indeed. i'm all concerned by those google and other things i've seen, but eh, that's a pr, the concern would be if that gets merged unmodified, not if the details of the implementation are made open to discussion... there are clearly communication mistakes and problematic things in the former proposed draft, but here we are not on twitter and things are expected to be discussed politely and _edited_... we're not there to do crowded harassment and satisfy our own ego building-up our feeling of being better at judging this or that. we're there to _help_ people making good software, including how to properly protect user data. that's because we are expected to _help_ the place is open to discussion. if pull-request threads were not for helping, github would just be another social emotion dealing platform."

836132456,835,Cheeseless,2021-05-10T03:53:30Z,"this being github has no bearing on the reality that the new maintainers of the project have no reason not to accept this pr outside of the outcry that is being raised, seeing as the whole telemetry package is being added on their command. if the acceptance or rejection of this pr was actually based on the soundness of its content in relation to creating good software, it would have been rejected fast enough to not receive any comments at all. and telemetry has now been indicated, by , to be a required component according to muse. this means that unless they choose to listen due to this outcry, the telemetry will be added, which invalidates any claim you are making about github's functionality being relevant to the situation."
836134301,835,illwieckz,2021-05-10T03:56:35Z,"i'm aware of this. i have read many of the comment there. but that's weird, people are acting like if they were on facebook, the best example being -ing just downvoting comments because of not being happy when seeing this or that comment he probably didn't expected, despite i just [a link] 40 minute ago and my comments were an addition on that topic so we are just agreeing... this is not a place for the concern of being happy or unhappy."
836138239,835,Cheeseless,2021-05-10T04:03:19Z,"i think you make a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of github, and that of software development as well. not all decisions that go into creating software are technical, they are often done on the basis of personal preference, intentional constraints, morals, ethics, and even financial interest. at the end of the day, every tool humankind uses is an attempt to gain the means to happiness. that a modification to one such tool causes this level of unhappiness, no matter what the underlying reason may be, is plenty enough to take such a minimally intrusive action as making a comment on a pr on github. you're right, this isn't facebook or twitter. but that does not mean that projects are not driven by human goals, and therefore human emotions."
836139590,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T04:05:42Z,i don't think a philosophical discussion about the nature of github is helping anything right now.

836163545,835,orenwatson,2021-05-10T04:44:00Z,"i don't think that there is anything irrational or emotional in not wanting software to send user data to google and yandex. i think this is a matter of morality. it is immoral to send user data to exploitative ad networks-- even if they don't realize that it is a bad idea to click a ""yes"" button to doing so; as you are then attempting to exploit their trust in you."
836164526,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T04:45:32Z,the audacity maintainers have already agreed to not send data from audacity users to google analytics or yandex. so i don't think discussing that point any further is helpful.
836168146,835,orenwatson,2021-05-10T04:50:40Z,"the fact is, that they currently send data from musescore users to ad networks."
836169499,835,illwieckz,2021-05-10T04:52:34Z,"so, what about renaming this pr the same way the pr description was edited? this would help lowering the misunderstanding from outside people to better focus on topic. i suggested to rename to something like ”make possible for users to help the project by contributing anonymous usage if they want to” instead of “basic telemetry for the audacity”. this would help to make the thread constructive. and if such suggested title doesn't fit well what is done, it means what is left to do is known, which is constructive as well."
836170211,835,orenwatson,2021-05-10T04:53:35Z,"the data sent is not anonymous, by the legal definition in gdpr."
836170906,835,Be-ing,2021-05-10T04:54:34Z,okay i think it's time to lock this discussion. nothing is being added anymore that hasn't been repeated many times already.
836171307,835,kneekoo,2021-05-10T04:55:09Z,"awesome! opt-in is the right way to do telemetry. this is bad. anyone who worked in it for a reasonable amount of time knows how people tend to click highlighted buttons. telemetry should be neutral, so don't highlight any button. this is poorly phrased. the first half mentions usage by platform, while the second half mentions stability. did you mean ""stability by platform"", so based on the combination of usage and stability you know how to set priorities in fixing issues? this is bad. opt-in telemetry will never tell you anything accurate about the true size of the user base. nice, this is a valid reason for telemetry. at the same time, you still can't tell if the collected telemetry is representative. this is why doing telemetry right is critical if you want more data - and it's still not fleshed out properly. this looks like the wrong approach because new features for version x don't warrant the effort of adding telemetry. they're supposed to be tested by the community, especially by those who can provide quality feedback. why use these in the first place? an opt-in mechanism will limit the number of reports from the get go, because most people don't want telemetry features enabled. why not start a telemetry service of your own, and see how it scales? these are fundamentally wrong. if someone enables telemetry and chooses yandex, it means you only get the ""application opened"" event, which is useless in determining anything useful about audacity's performance, stability and environment (os). this makes it look like you want to determine market share more than anything. this is completely wrong. surely you are aware that feeding data into data-hogging companies is unacceptable for a lot of people. the point of telemetry should be to improve the development process, so if you want to maximize the amount of useful data to enable that, make the right choice from the beginning. why complicate things by working with two different platforms, then migrate to another? it takes time and effort to handle those, so do that for your own service, which will also make more people happy and forthcoming with the telemetry feature."
836200904,835,StarWitch,2021-05-10T05:36:45Z,"for ux issues such as a ui where nobody can find a specific tool, telemetry won't tell you a single damn thing unless you're doing extremely invasive eye- or mouse-tracking, and frankly, i'm not even sure if robust libraries exist for such a thing on anything that isn't an electron app. it will not actually help anything insofar as ux improvements any more than asking for feedback or doing proper first-time user testing. for crashes and bugs, there's always the classic crash reporter that so many apps already use. you know what telemetry *is* useful for, though? market share. i guarantee that ultimate guitar wants telemetry because it makes them look good to potential investors by demonstrating how much of a ""market share"" their new ""brand"" (audacity) has, and how much time people spend using the app. anyone who has actually worked with telemetry data knows this, including myself. in a very distant second, it can tell you if anyone is actually using a niche platform and if it's worth supporting at all - but again, that's mostly a side-effect of knowing your market share rather than a direct benefit. leave the telemetry at the door, apologize, and hope the foss community forgives the project over the next year. maybe even consider removing telemetry from musescore as a sign of good-will. if _not adding telemetry_ is unacceptable, then we can effectively consider this app ""free as in beer"" rather than ""free as in freedom"" as it's clear that this project no longer belongs to the community with a company shepherding it, but to a business more interested in taking over projects and talking down to the community. more of a google than a linux foundation."

836320657,835,domsson,2021-05-10T07:52:39Z,"-- [a link] -- [a link] thank you very much, this hits the nail on the head. please see the above. that's what a lot of people here assume, simply because it logically makes sense. if we just look at the [a link] page, we can see they indeed do love to boast numbers. this is something you _have_ to be open about, even if that means the community will disagree. further, one huge question that is still on the table is _how_ muse group has even ""acquired"" audacity, a free and open source project. are the core maintainers, or some of them, now on muse group's pay roll? who exactly is muse group and what is their vision for audacity? what rights and power does muse group have over audacity, exactly? all of this is confusing and should be cleared up - it is _directly_ relevant to the discussion at hand. for example, what if muse group won't back down about tracking, but the community won't either?"
836352962,835,famiu,2021-05-10T08:21:11Z,"this. exactly how does one ""acquire"" a gpl project? because from my understanding, it belongs to the contributors and only to the contributors."
836355997,835,illwieckz,2021-05-10T08:23:56Z,"this is one of the most important questions about the future of audacity. for example, in 2010 the owner of the nexuiz name sold it to a company, but the actual developers of the nexuiz open source game were in fact contributors from the community and not involved in the deal. the new owner of the nexuiz name released a game in 2012... without success, even xbox 360 servers were shut down in 2013... those who were developers of the original nexuiz game before the selling of the name had to continue the development under another name ([a link] since the name was acquired by the other company. but while xonotic is still more popular than the new nexuiz the name transfer deal was about, it never recovered its visibility and reputation (even the french wikipedia deleted the xonotic page [a link] because of lack of visibility). i even met people who mistakenly believed xonotic was the non-community project... another story with similar effects even if the turn of events was different: old time contributors to openoffice had to pick a new name ([a link] when oracle acquired the name in 2010 as part of sun's catalog without interest for the development of the software itself. 10 years later, i've heard that there is still people to download outdated openoffice, as much as the ones downloading libreoffice. i even met people not knowing about libreoffice this year. so, someone got the audacity name, but what about the community? i'm not in favor of a fork, because if muse group owns the audacity name, the fork will never recover the decade old reputation of audacity and recognition, there may even be people deleting the pages about the community fork every three years on third-party website like wikipedia because of lack of reputation (so, chicken and egg problem). and the audacity-named software would just lose all the contributions, owning the name of a dead project, like owning dead nexuiz and dead openoffice. this would be bad for muse group, bad for audacity developers, bad for audacity users. a fork would be bad for everyone and it would hurt the world for decades. so, the real problem is, how to make muse group and audacity community reconcile themselves. maybe muse group may give up on this or that data that is not worth the loose of the contributors and users for example, and well, as people we may help muse group to know what must not be done and what is best to do. for sure i would not recommend users to give up on data protection. it's often better to know less about users but to keep the users. on the other hand there is probably a place for an opt-out way to contribute some anonymous usage data to help making the software better, but yes that must be opt-out and truly anonymous."
836466532,835,domsson,2021-05-10T09:33:01Z,i agree and have therefore opened an [a link]. that should be a better place to discuss this topic than a closed pr for a tracking feature.

838680722,835,falkTX,2021-05-11T15:27:28Z,read the backlog if you want to know why. not all of us are complicit and don't care. the amount of add-ons needed to make browsing the web a proper experience clearly shows browsers are not a model to follow.
838783331,835,BenBE,2021-05-11T16:25:27Z,"because the negative aspects very much outweigh the downsides. read the discussion for more details. and even with browsers there are enough people quite angry with the situation. but given the implications there (about 4 days for custom builds to remove tracking, when building from source on your own hardware and not everybody can manage this) there's unfortunately not much alternatives to choose from. but that's a different topic. that's what the pr officially says. the actual patch had several issues that inverted this logic and thus made it active by default as well as anti-patterns that coerced the user to just click thru to enable it. oh, and that telemetry was neither anonymous (use of known advertiser services) nor was it limited to actual telemetry only: the pr includes an uuid per user, thus allows for tracking of installations. which brings us back to the browsers: have you actually tried to build audacity from source? do you think this is a sustainable solution for the average user? overall there are much better alternatives to baking telemetry directly into the core application. one for example is having telemetry added by a plugin that the user consciously installs. this also has the advantage that everything the telemetry monitors would also be available by official apis for other plugins to use. doing it that way also guarantees the agreement to the collection of personalizable information under gdpr in conscious, informed and voluntary."

838826849,835,BenBE,2021-05-11T16:56:37Z,"there's lots of virtue signalling in the comments, unfortunately. this pr introduces a full network stack into an application that successfully managed without one for over 20 years. thus introducing one really should have a very good reason and given the expected overall quality of the collected information the data ain't the compelling reason in this matter. there are simply too many threads attached that negatively affect the quality of the collected data, thus there's much easier and worthwhile methods to produce even better statistics to base your decisions on. remains the part regarding crash reports: one of the few points that i agree. unfortunately even here you don't really need to introduce networking into the core application. to give one example: `htop` simply gives a backtrace, some basic information required for a bug report and instruction how to help to make the backtrace more informative (basically: how you call `objdump` - or its equivalent - on your platform so you can attach that file to the bug report). this gives the option for the user to opt-in sending the bug report and still manages to respect the freedom of the user to not being tracked by the application. if you want to make it more friendly for beginners you could even use a separate application that pops up just when the main application crashed (like firefox and several other tools do), but even then the main application does not need any linkage to any networking stack. and fwiw: the information that `htop` asks the user to provide usually helps to pin down the exact line of the crash within about 20 minutes, even when handling the `objdump` file by hand. could be more convenient to do, but the fact is, that the actual bug reporting can and should be fully offline."

1479309080,4414,DavidBailes,2023-03-22T10:37:58Z,"some accessibility issues: time signature toolbar screen readers do not read the names of the two wxspinctrls. i don't know of a quick fix for this. normally the fix for being able to have an accessibility name where there is no visible label is setting windowaccessible as the control's accessible object. alas in this case, this doesn't work as it sets the accessible name of the spinner control rather than the text box which is the focus. on windows, by default, wxwidgets uses a native control for a wxspinctrl. from include\wx\msw\spinctrl.h: // under win32, wxspinctrl is a wxspinbutton with a buddy (as msdn docs call // it) text window whose contents is automatically updated when the spin // control is clicked. (in contrast for a wxspinctrldouble, on windows wxwidgets uses a generic control. in this case, the structure is a window containing a text box and a spinner thing. with a visible label, the accessibility name of the containing window is automatically set to this label. this is no good, since again the text box is again the focus. however one can derive a class from wxspinctrldouble, where one has access to the text control, and so make it accessible by setting a windowaccessible as the text control's accessibility object, and overriding setname to set the name of the text box.) snapping toolbar 1. was a check box chosen in preference to a toggle button because its state is clearer to see? (a toggle button could have been pressed using enter, a standard keystroke for a button). in the realtime effect dialogs, a keyboard user has to use a platform dependent keystroke to interact with controls which normally accept spacebar. (on macos, for buttons and check boxes, option + spacebar; on windows, using either standard or full defaults, for check boxes, ctrl + spacebar; on xubuntu, for check boxes, enter.) users of screen readers also have another alternative, but i'm ignoring this here, as the application needs to be keyboard accessible whether of not a screen reader is in use. for the snapping checkbox, i see that enter can be used, without the need for a platform dependent keystroke. is it intended that this can also be used in the realtime effect dialogs? (this would rely on them remaining without a default button.) 2. it would be better if the snapping interval drop down list had an accessibility name such as ""snapping interval"" or whatever the best name is for this, rather than an empty name. selection toolbar it would be more convenient if the two numeric controls were adjacent in the tab order (as they are in previous versions of audacity) - ie a tab order of: setup button, first numeric control, second numeric control."
1482568619,4414,dozzzzer,2023-03-24T10:20:30Z,"it seems that snapping logic disregards the lower time signature value. for example, let's set snapping value equal to **1 bar** and look how snapping works when **4/4** time signature is set: ![a link] now, let's change the lower time signature value to a half of the previous one, i.e. time signature now is 4/2. observe how selection now snaps to half the value, i.e. 1/2 bar while visually it remains the same as in previous example: ![a link]"
1482570909,4414,crsib,2023-03-24T10:22:20Z,what exactly is tempo is discussed right now :-)
1482588996,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-24T10:36:50Z,"i have fetched the most recent force-push, and it only affects the commits i have not yet reviewed thoroughly. a general comment. the beatsformatter ends up in lib-numeric-formats anyway, despite the effort of making a registry. and in the commit following that one, there is intrusion in numericconverter.h to finish whatever is happening here. the purpose of a registration system is open-endedness, but this does not completely realize it. i don't say this problem must be completely cured for release but the organization could be reconsidered later."
1482596179,4414,crsib,2023-03-24T10:42:57Z,"why the location of the file affects open endianness? it can be moved into a different library with no effort. the reason i have started the crusade against `numericconverter` is it's extreme level of unreadability and heavy reliance on the global state. i could've modified the original implementation, but that would be similarly complex and likely more error prone. as you can observe, beats format cannot be represented within the current framework used by numericconverter."
1482599124,4414,crsib,2023-03-24T10:45:30Z,"and i had impression that we are doing a step-by-step work, not all or nothing. otherwise i am confused about the amount of the ui details numericconverter had after being split from the control."
1483179835,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-24T17:39:43Z,"indeed we do incremental work, and you leave this code better than it was, although some dependencies among the green libraries still seem less than ideal to me. if it is too difficult now to follow every suggestion to achieve what i think is better organization, it can be done later. it won't be the first pull request just to reorganize libraries, as you surely know. if ui details were still in lib-numeric-formats, it's because i wasn't pursuing perfection but i was doing sufficient to make a green library and unblock the extraction of lib-effects into the green, which was a very big prize."
1483819059,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-25T13:04:38Z,"regarding the doubts about the loss of the translatable string, when putting only the identifier part of `numericformatsymbol` into a wxevent: really, `numericformatsymbol` is an unnecessary type, and formats should be identified simply by a `taggedidentifier` type. see commit 0fb02a8024a442c571ed6e6dbd53c55da9f4a093 from 2017 where i changed `xo(""seconds"")` to `{ xo(""seconds"") }` and similar in the big table of formats, changing plain strings (`xo` expanded then just to `wxt`) with identifier-translatable pairs. the commit comment explains that translated strings were getting stored in the .cfg file, but that was wrong: locale-independent identifiers should have been used. but in fact the `msgid()` function is never used for those symbols. this isn't very easy to prove, but i have prepared a few buildable commits transforming the code to prove it to myself. now i don't know whether the translations were otherwise used in 2017, but maybe they weren't -- in which case, the real ancient mistake, traceable to 2010, was that these strings were just marked for i18n unnecessarily. i no longer want to add commits to your branch, but will prepare my own pull requests to make this simplification as a code quality improvement that isn't necessary for 3.3."
1483821290,4414,crsib,2023-03-25T13:15:48Z,"we do use those strings for labels, so they have to be translated. we could've had 2 strings instead - one for id and the second for display purposes, but it is not how it works now."
1483831248,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-25T13:55:29Z,"right, some of what i said was nonsense. what's not nonsense is that numericformatsymbol requires much less widespread use. the sole place where the translation does affect anything is where `numerictextctrl::oncontext` visits the registry. in fact the type could be eliminated and `numericconverterregistryitem` could just expose an `identifier` and a `translatablestring` separately. that's what i really proved to myself with the help of some code changes and the compiler."
1483831852,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-25T13:58:17Z,"i have pushed a commit, just a small and unimportant fix for a bug that was prior to this pull request."
1483889471,4414,Paul-Licameli,2023-03-25T18:19:24Z,"and i'm done with this round. i need to reread all my comments and decide which ones i must really insist on and which are only suggestions. i may get to that tuesday. between now and then you may force push a branch with any fixes you agree with, perhaps squashed into the history."

1747030323,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-04T14:47:20Z,sorry i oversaw that. commits between your comment and now address this.
1747034185,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-04T14:49:22Z,actually i also hit some assert if the length of generated audio is greater than the selection - doesn't have to be nyquist. (don't know how it looks in a release build.) looking into this ...
1747843470,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-05T00:30:28Z,intermediate step “waveclip::paste handles stretch ratio differences” now fails to build
1747864630,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-05T00:52:53Z,the build failure is fixed three commits later
1748341777,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-05T08:11:46Z,"i found the issue, which indeed didn't concern nyquist only but also some generators (e.g. tone generator). generating audio over a selection for a duration greater than the selection was buggy. (haven't checked if it was also buggy for durations less than the selection.) with the tone generator, the duration is set per default to the selection duration, but not with the nyquist generator, and that got you to notice the bug. for what it's worth, the fix didn't involve modifying that complicated `clearandpaste` method, but usages of it, so i'm optimistic that this change won't break other things."
1748577432,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-05T10:13:23Z,i attempted no debugging of this. have you fixed it?
1748653258,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-05T10:55:13Z,my review of new commits is complete
1748783382,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-05T12:19:31Z,yes.
1749057244,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-05T14:45:47Z,-licameli finished addressing your comments.

1750861113,5043,dozzzzer,2023-10-06T15:11:08Z,tested. no new issues were found.
1751013169,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-06T16:10:05Z,fini!
1751050691,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-06T16:25:27Z,likewise :)
1751066025,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-06T16:30:36Z,will i see this soon?
1751071861,5043,saintmatthieu,2023-10-06T16:33:25Z,![a link] wanted to be eco-friendly saving a build by waiting for rebase.
1751093400,5043,Paul-Licameli,2023-10-06T16:43:29Z,just mine some bitcoin to pay for the environmental impact.
1625191606,4881,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-07T10:18:10Z,"so i made a cursory review, to check that each commit builds (but they don't). i haven't attempted the detailed review. i see nothing for the envelope tool. can i expect to see something today?"
1625283741,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-07T11:38:34Z,oh that one slipped from my mind. will give it a whack. about to push commits for hopefully acceptable spectrum display.
1625322579,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-07T12:11:04Z,ready for review.
1625897799,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-07T18:56:31Z,"i have to stop now. -licameli here is what i know remains to be done: ### remaining features (besides destructive effects and joint-stereo) #### drawing: * pencil drag-drawing : some edge samples can get missed when doing fast movements over the edge of a clip, but otherwise works nicely, including interpolation * brush: similarly, edge samples happen to be set to extreme values, looking like uninitialized floats. * caching: samples are read and written directly from the database. i think it should be easy to adapt the apis i've added to `waveclip` (`setfloatsfromtime`, `getfloatattime`, etc.) to return an `audiosegmentsampleview` and have the drawing code keep the reference count from dropping to 0. #### copy, change tempo, paste: that doesn't work at all. #### selection ignores tempo changes. haven't looked into that at all. ### what works (or should) the rest works to my satisfaction : * waveform display * envelope * spectrum display (directly on clips, `cachingsamplesequence` is dismissed) * etc. i will try to communicate and maybe address minor things sporadically over the week-end, but it is probably safer to assume me gone. fyi"
1625903286,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-07T18:59:16Z,-licameli i haven't done a proper commit squashing as you wished. you'll also see that i have disregarded method documentation. i hope their implementation is clear enough for you to add them by yourself when you take over. sorry about that.
1626068033,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-07T20:41:19Z,-licameli fyi i have created (yet another) branch with the stretch-handle poc code cherry-picked : [a link]
1658492505,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-07-31T14:34:29Z,reset this pr to draft until copy-paste and other left-over non-trivial issues are fixed.
1671420968,4881,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-09T14:18:21Z,"no comments about commits 2, 3, and 4 out of 13, except that 2 has some conflict with `last-track-iteration-rewrites` but easily resolved."
1671452592,4881,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-09T14:22:43Z,"commit 5 ""project tempo changes affect waveclip stretch ratios"" has another conflict. the commit comment tells me you may knowingly cause assertion violations. that should be avoided even in an intermediate commit if it's not hard. can you tell me which asserts might be the problem?"
1673036112,4881,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-10T11:23:26Z,"catching my breath now, i'm done with the first difficult commit ""project tempo changes affect waveclip stretch ratios"", except that i didn't reexamine every `getvisiblesamplecount`, `timetosamples`, `samplestotime` to convince myself of the completeness of the necessary changes."
1678623283,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-08-15T09:01:34Z,"as far as i recall this wasn't something trivial to fix. calculations in `fillwhere` not accounting for stretching leading to wrong sample indices i think, and then some `std::clamp` complaining about being given inconsistent limits."
1679262150,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-08-15T16:32:44Z,"as per -licameli 's wish, i broke down this pr in smaller ones. these are #5040 to #5045. closing this one."
1679263603,4881,saintmatthieu,2023-08-15T16:33:58Z,-licameli i see you posted new comments. will address them on the relevant branches.
1178858297,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-08T11:05:41Z,"on macos: 1. record and count to ten aloud. 2. open sidebar and add audynamicsprocessor (an example with an output meter) 3. play, then press the gear wheel to open the dialog (or, press the gear first and then play) 4. observe that the output metering does not work in master now, at step 3 you can only press the gear first before playing (the point of this pr is to overcome that limitation) but in master, there is some updating of the output meter (not at a fast enough rate, but that's another problem to figure out)."
1178897619,3176,crsib,2022-07-08T11:49:38Z,"i'm not sure if i follow you. this pr provides a fix for a major ux issue, i do not see how is it related to output metering. current ux makes real-time effects pretty much useless"
1178903564,3176,crsib,2022-07-08T11:56:10Z,"btw following you steps i observe that output metering works (very slow, yes)"
1178921310,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-08T12:16:02Z,"i said it works, but slowly, in master yet not at all in your branch. are you agreeing with all that?"
1178930634,3176,crsib,2022-07-08T12:26:22Z,i understand the reason of the problem and thinking of a solution now
1178959364,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-08T12:56:55Z,i have my own thoughts about solution but have turned attention to other reviews since identifying the problem and haven't written them down precisely.
1178961181,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-08T12:58:49Z,"general idea: some parts of realtimeeffect state that are not now copied, should be put in a structure managed by a `shared_ptr` which is copied. this includes the pointer to the instance. the complications with clientdata and effectsettingsaccesstee may all be unnecessary. but i must look at it closer to make this precise and see if it all makes sense."
1179024497,3176,crsib,2022-07-08T14:01:30Z,"yep, exactly the way i plan approaching it i still like the idea of ui to be attached separately, but this can be moved to be a part of realtimeeffectstate itself . the ui controller will be much more simple though. yep, that won't be needed, but i think keeping it ""public"" does not harm. the main question is still about the undo/redo stacks. right now ""copying"" instance has a side effect of preserving the effect settings in the undo stack. i'm not sure if it is a desired behavior provided that undo/redo for parameters is postponed and is not implement is several other daws at all. without undo/redo preservation i do not see much complexity required to fix the issue you brought up"
1192428999,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T10:30:25Z,"not yet a complete review. i pushed a suggested nicer looking way (to me anyway) to implement ""do not set effect to be a controller..."""
1192440871,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T10:45:03Z,"your commit introduces a new dependency for the `lib-components`, it now requires access to wxwindow. i'm still checking if it works at all."
1192447329,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T10:53:04Z,so is it really worth introducing a new dependency just to remove on `if`? i say it is up to you.
1192457464,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T11:05:34Z,"oh my, how did i overlook that? good point: if lib-components should only use wxbase, then the defaulteffectuivalidator subclass should also be moved somewhere else, into audacity. however, actually lib-components and effectuiclientinterface is still a somewhat confused and confusing piece of the legacy code. there used to be several other badly named interface classes with unclear purpose that i figured out how to eliminate in this release. effectuiclientinterface is still one of those unsatisfying ones i haven't figured out how to clean up just yet."
1192460093,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T11:08:48Z,"to be fair, at some point we will need to have some façade for the event handlers anyway. so probably we can allow linking to `wxwidgets::core` here for now i am really confused about it, yes :-)"
1192463796,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T11:13:47Z,"you mention nyquist effects too now, which are also never realtime capable, but i don't see special treatment of them in this branch. nyquist and noisereduction are also the only effects that override showhostinterface specially, and one of your commits deletes a call to showhostinterface. so is this part of the explanation?"
1192471705,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T11:23:46Z,"looking on `int effect::showclientinterface` i think the reason is that noisereduction behaves very differently from other effects, including nyquist. i have no strong feelings about that change and i'm happy to remove it."
1192474898,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T11:27:46Z,"i will make another pr about the popping of event handlers, and you can rebase onto it if it is approved and merged. it will also move defaulteffectuivalidator to audacity."
1192479969,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T11:34:26Z,"hope i will see it soon, this pr will require vast amount of testing."
1192487127,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T11:43:35Z,see #3276
1192496698,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T11:56:26Z,"well, that was really quick, thank you, paul!"
1192497890,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-22T11:58:01Z,"the proper complementary pushing and popping was a detail i recall having doubts about, and i'm glad to have reviewed and settled it to my satisfaction now."
1192708881,3176,crsib,2022-07-22T15:47:16Z,i have rebased and force-pushed. i removed `showclientinterface` override as well.
1195299720,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-26T10:24:54Z,"this completes a round of review of the lines of code changed, but now i need to reread the bullet points in the issue and consider whether they were all addressed."
1195307506,3176,crsib,2022-07-26T10:33:01Z,"please consider the *expected* design, not the one currently implemented for the effect ui dialog."
1197934730,3176,crsib,2022-07-28T10:03:49Z,i have fixed the issues found during the previous run
1198670475,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-28T21:55:43Z,"it's not true that edits that push the undo stack make the non-modal dialog disappear, but it seems any undo or redo makes it disappear even if ""the same"" track with ""the same"" state still exists. is that acceptable to design and qa? i don't know. i won't block the merge for that, but i do want the dependency cycle problem addressed."
1198688647,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-28T22:24:38Z,"break, also, the dependency of `projectwindow` on `realtimeeffectpanel` (a dependency made earlier when the panel was introduced, not by you) and that cycle shrinks, not to one, but still excluding the new file added in 3.2, which is then not in a cycle with anything else. how to do that? it needs some manoeuvres with `globalhook` probably, that i might figure out in stabilization or for patch release. so don't you worry about that one small addition to the cycle up in the ui layer. but please do unblock the extraction of lib-audio-io."
1205394521,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T15:14:16Z,"some thoughts: if mmainsettings is moved into the shared state, then there is no need for noninterfering and the related templates to avoid false sharing, which simplifies the macos build problem. but i think it should not be moved into the shared state. if you keep copying it as before, then it will be possible for a state's settings to be different at different points of undo history. even if there are not distinct undo/redo items just for changes of settings, it may be an improvement to call modifystate whenever the non-modal dialog closes. this is done when you change the power button states. observe how it works. make some edit, and then toggle power. undo and redo. what do you expect for power button state? what you get is how you last left the button, before the undo; not the button as it was when the undo state was first pushed on the stack. modifystate is also used for things like changes of the selected times."
1205396615,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T15:16:01Z,that is separate from the lifetime problems that must be addressed to avoid the crashes in idle time for lv2 effects.
1205426269,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T15:39:57Z,"maybe do the opposite, though: put worker settings into shared state. undo history has versions of main settings, which is copied by the copy constructor of the state, but doesn't need multiple worker settings just taking up space. then no need for `sharednoninterfering` or `noninterfering`."
1205432792,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T15:45:15Z,"should `mid` and `mplugin` remain in shared state? yes. there is no need to reassign them after a state is made. replacement of one effect with another is implemented as construction of a new `realtimeeffectstate` with its own different, new shared state."
1205433599,3176,crsib,2022-08-04T15:45:55Z,"i'm not sure if i like your idea on project history. as a user - this is not a behavior i would expect. i close a non modal dialog, press ctrl-z, and everything is reverted without my knowledge about that. please, let's agree that changes to effect settings do not affect project history for now, we will return to it after 3.2."
1205436625,3176,crsib,2022-08-04T15:48:34Z,"my proposal stands - i think that all of the state should be shared. i just need your confirmation, because you have designed this system and better understand possible problems that will occur due to this change"
1205480173,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T16:23:40Z,"this is a question to put to design, really not for either of us to decide unless the implementation difficulties are simply too great, but i think they would not be. i did the power buttons deliberately as they are with leo's agreement. however the matter can be ignored for the purpose of this pull request and revisited as a separate issue."
1205492886,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T16:30:53Z,"i missed where exactly you proposed that all state be shared -- but that would include worker settings, unlike in the version i reviewed. yes, i think that may be right -- excepting perhaps the main settings -- and could solve the assertion violation that happened for lv2 idle. so the undo/redo history will surely include the changes of composition of the list -- adding, removing, replacing, permuting the states. but there would be no more weak pointer in the effectsettingsaccess object that could expire because of replacetrack. instead it could hold another shared_ptr to sharedstate. i'm going to review again all that exists in the present master version of realtimeeffectstate to be sure this would work."
1205521420,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T16:53:45Z,"if main and worker settings remain in the same structure, whether the shared or the unshared state -- then you should use `noninterfering`."
1205526757,3176,crsib,2022-08-04T16:59:11Z,power buttons are different: 1. you revert your last action. this is not true for the rest of the settings. effect can have 50 parameters easily and ctrl-z will revert all changes to all 50 parameters. 2. you see the result. in this case - the action is completely hidden from user. consider that you change settings in you ide and they are reverted when you press ctrl-z after closing the window. the case that effect settings bypass the project history has been already discussed a lot. please let's not spend more time on it.
1205530295,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T17:02:46Z,"i'm not convinced that the issue has been settled knowingly by designers. there was a specification for undo/redo history strings from setting changes in the original design. i think a *different* issue card could be opened for this an reconsidered in 3.3. however the easy thing for now is not to address the issue (even if not forgetting the issue either), and we will agree to do the easiest thing for now, so that we do get the non-modality."
1205531226,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-04T17:03:43Z,"this is *not* the other question of the esc key, which was knowingly settled in favor of doing nothing about it."
1205604540,3176,Tantacrul,2022-08-04T18:12:11Z,i would say it is likely that any reference to undo/redo in the design was not properly considered. probably a throwaway line - although i can't find it myself.
1213281546,3176,crsib,2022-08-12T16:09:57Z,please don't
1213530462,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-12T21:23:09Z,"remaining problem (at least): - generate noise - add an effect to the stack - click the gear - undo expect: the dialog should disappear, because the effect is no longer in the track's stack, even though the track still exists. the dialog now holds a `shared_ptr` to state, referred to elsewhere only be redo states. the dialog remains open and won't have a dangling pointer, but it presents dials that have no influence on the sound when you play back."
1214169676,3176,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-13T14:38:22Z,"maybe this is a solution for all the undo problems, which won't need trackid after all: - intercept the track deletions that happen when popping undo state, as you do now, and remember those tracks. - then the event comes from the undo manager, after the current tracklist in the project is repopulated. - find all realtimeeffectstateui that are showing, and ""reachable"" from the old tracks. meaning, of course, you can visit the states in their realtimeeffectlists and find them. - find all that are reachable from the new list of tracks. - close the uis in the first set and not the second. then this is enough to hide uis either in case undo removes the track, or undo leaves (some state of) the track in the project but the track no longer has the realtimeeffectstate any more."
1214382985,3176,crsib,2022-08-14T13:54:47Z,"all proposed changes are implemented, -licameli"
1682205933,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-17T12:33:44Z,"i just bisected a bug to the commit ""make waveform display work again"", but don't fully understand it yet. - empty project - make stereo track - select some range of time later than 0 - generate > noise observe: the channels appear misaligned."
1682209060,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-17T12:35:41Z,that appears to be only a display problem. real playback is correct.
1682492151,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-17T15:31:57Z,-licameli i cannot reproduce it. if you could figure it out that'd be great.
1689783683,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-23T11:21:49Z,"you might do this still, or not"
1689848961,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-23T12:10:46Z,now that is my complete round of review! i think the points raised will be easy to resolve and the repeat round will be fast.
1689878312,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-23T12:31:20Z,approved! please squash all commits after 560bc7dfcb903c393e03f2580fedb33b9ea1be9b into one.
1689979096,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-23T13:35:30Z,i have combined the qa checklists from two prs.
1690255389,5041,dozzzzer,2023-08-23T16:18:27Z,"found issues : - when time-stretching from the left side (the beginning) of the clip, then dragging the new, time-stretched clip back to the zero time mark and playing the clip, it freezes for a few seconds before starting the playback. the subsequent attempts to play resulted in no stuttering. it also seems that the higher the stretch ratio is, the longer it waits before actually playing the track: [a link] (a non-related to this pr issue logged as #5088) - when shrinking a 1-minute clip to the minimum length, playback also starts after a short pause a couple of seconds long. also, when shrinking a 1-minute mono clip to the minimum length, duplicating it, making it into a stereo track, and hitting play, the pause time seems to double in time - deadlock when placing two clips with different stretch ratios next to each other and then pressing z on the keyboard (= at zero crossings): [a link] - when mixing-and-rendering a time-stretched clip (to a new track) and then measuring the contrast (_analyze > contrast_) or the rms value (_analyze > measure rms_) on both, the mixed-and-rendered one always appears to be a few db quieter than the original time-stretched one: [a link] - also noticed that when playing from the cursor immediately after stretching a clip, playback starts with a slight delay of maybe half a second as opposed to regular playback as well as all subsequent playbacks on the stretched clip that start immediately - when importing a stereo file (wav/mp3) and adding some envelope points, visually only the left channel seems to be affected, even though in fact both left and right channel amplitudes are affected: ![a link] - when stretching a clip using some extreme stretch ratios (e.g. stretching a 30-second mono chirp up to 12 hours), attempting to play the clip causes deadlock. we perhaps should introduce upper boundaries for the stretch factor - stretching a clip on a track that is part of a sync lock group doesn't cause other tracks of this group to shift in time as well; this is gonna be logged as a separate issue and is yet to be discussed with the design team, so please disregard this one - beat finder analyzer fails on a time-stretched clip, e.g. a shrunk rhythm track: [a link] - beat finder may cause deadlock when applied on a clip that is stretched by changing the tempo to a lower value: [a link] - poor processing of synthetic tones, such as chirp. when stretched and then mixed and rendered, it has louder peaks than the original: - in a sync-locked track group, time-stretching a clip doesn't cause other tracks of the group to shift in time. logged as [a link] - occasionally, the uploaded to audio.com version of the stretched file would have a different length than the one in the project; this happens rarely and under certain specific circumstances that i'm yet unable to figure out - when copying a shrunk clip and pasting it alongside, then rendering the sequence of two clips, the left and the right halves of the resulting clip look differently (see the images below); the issue is fixed now in the most recent version of the branch though. before: after:"
1692972178,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-25T08:28:20Z,"thanks a lot for your findings so far. this is already in 3.3.3 :grimacing_face: please try the exact same on the current release, using trimming instead of stretching. the reason : before trimming, you select the entire clip. during trimming, the selection stays the same. when you shift the clip left, it also shifts the selection to the left, past the zero mark. and when you press play, it plays the selecting region, i.e. starting at second -10 ... imo this _is_ a strange behaviour, that _could_ be acceptable if the option to see past the zero mark is checked, but probably not if it isn't, right? hasn't anyone complained about that so far? ?"
1693097518,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-25T09:50:54Z,staffpad's time stretcher doesn't seem to like the way we configure it and extremely low stretch ratios. it may be a simple fix. wip.
1693121998,5041,dozzzzer,2023-08-25T10:10:39Z,:ok_hand: logged as #5088
1693291102,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-25T12:36:33Z,perhaps i should examine the problem with envelope display. recently i merged to master some changes in envelopes. are you sure nothing was wrong already in master?
1693299781,5041,dozzzzer,2023-08-25T12:43:12Z,"yes, current `master` isn't affected, i.e. envelopes of both channels of a stereo track can be edited simultaneously."
1695841932,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-28T14:52:03Z,"i re-approve this branch with the new commits, to the extent i understand it (this excludes changes inside the staffpad library)"
1695856269,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-28T15:00:44Z,"time stretching will modify the samples, and so we cannot expect the exact same contrast before and after rendering. then the follow-up question is: should we display the value for the raw data (as now) or the stretching-rendered result ? i'm not sure that the former would be preferrable. something similar happens with real-time effects: select e.g. bass & treble, reducing both bands by several dbs. the contrast-command result is that of the raw audio. if you mix and render, and run contrast again, you get a different result. so i'd leave it as it is. ?"
1695884463,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-28T15:17:47Z,"i'm not sure. maybe we have discovered a subtle bug for the staffpad guys to figure out. i think you could prove that transforming one fft window, changing phases only, and then doing ifft, should leave rms unchanged. but that does neglect the complications of windowing functions, overlap-add, etc. still i would hope that time stretching of a sustained tone should at least preserve rms with some cancelling-out of these effects over many windows."
1696353670,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-28T20:17:36Z,"that's correct, modifying the phases of the components of a signal doesn't change its rms. also, i shared pictures on discord of the effect of the time stretcher on a square wave. the waveform is greatly affected, but the rms stays the same - roughly. looking closer you can see it oscillating. that could be one reason. the other reason could be delay. sp's stretcher reports a delay value that should be reviewed. we discard that many samples at the beginning of the output, but i've seen, for strong stretch ratios, signs that this may be an underestimate or overestimate, depending on the stretch direction. this could lead to discarded samples, affecting the analysis result - and other more critical problems, like truncated boundaries. seems not be noticeable at typical ratios and we may get away with it for now, though."
1696940206,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-29T07:46:51Z,"i'm not sure how to reproduce that. a quick attempt didn't succeed. the number of tracks, sample rate, length, stretch ratios, all could play a role. maybe make a project available for me?"
1696956241,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-29T07:59:14Z,"-licameli provided a fix with commit 1468879. just tested it, works fine."
1697560832,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-29T14:29:57Z,"since * the need for such drastic outward stretching is very, very unlikely, * a fix in the staffpad library isn't easy (it'd mean supporting analysis hop sizes of less than 1 sample), * setting up limits would take some, if so not much, development time, we agreed together with eventually to let it come as a bug if it ever gets reported."
1697588192,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-29T14:44:54Z,"when a waveform's components' phases relationship change (which is inherent to pitch-preserving time stretching), the shape of the waveform changes, too. for synthetic, complex waveforms with distinctive shapes such as square, triangle or sawtooth waves, this is very noticeable. it comes with a change of peak values (but rms should be preserved, at least roughly), which is partly what we observe here. that said, we've identified with and a pattern, whereby compressing a clip lowers its rms, and expanding it, increases its rms. for typical, musical usage of time stretching this is probably small enough not to be noticeable, but an improvement here would be welcome, possibly as patch release. the fact that louder peaks may cause clipping upon playback is something we decided not to do anything about. clip indicators are there to make the user aware of it. doing anything ourselves proactively would change characteristics of the waveform in likely unwanted ways. like -licameli said, it's the maths of it - let the user decide how to deal with it."
1697610897,5041,Paul-Licameli,2023-08-29T14:57:11Z,"you know that there is a checkmark item in the view menu that paints the track red wherever it clips? this is useful and i have wished it were the default. if the stretch algorithm calculates sample values out of the [-1, 1] bounds, still those numbers are preserved if in 32 bit float format, and even persist in the .aup3 file. it is still possible to normalize or compress or limit the result to get back a track that does not clip. experienced users may just have to learn this and be aware."
1698226164,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-29T22:27:29Z,"yes, leo showed the clipping markers. normalizing or even just lowering the gain, and, for display, zooming out vertically on the level ruler."
1698667637,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-30T07:48:59Z,"beat finder problems are effect-related, and will be fixed in 5-of-6. please ignore for now. i tested on that other branch, and it works."
1698809880,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-08-30T09:23:21Z,"all your boxes are checked. comments to some of those: ... or louder, depending on the stretch direction (squeezing -> quieter, expanding -> louder). as we agreed together with , this will probably be subject for a patch release and should not block this release. please ignore for now, will be fixed with the pr that fixes destructive effects. could not reproduce this. comes with the pre-processing of clips stretched to large amounts : squeezed and a lot of input has to be analyzed to output just a few samples, expanded and the synthesis will first output lots of near-zero values that must be discarded. this takes time, nothing we can do about it without delving in the staffpad algorithm and risk breaking things while optimizing. i expect this lag for ""normal"" ratios not to be noticeable."
1702387317,5041,saintmatthieu,2023-09-01T08:41:40Z,thanks -licameli for contributing and pushing this forward !
1702505088,5041,dozzzzer,2023-09-01T10:07:10Z,"tested: - all checklist items - plot spectrum applied to an extremely stretched-out clip now doesn't cause the freeze - the freeze when using at zero crossings is now fixed - the mixer board issue is gone - the right channel of a stereo track ignoring the envelope points is fixed as well out of scope of this pr: - stretched clips are quieter (logged as #5123) and clipping ([a link] - beat finder issues (will be addressed in ""5 of 6"" pr) - extremely shrunk clip causes delay and stutter when played back (the ""limitation"" of the algorithm; see 's comment above) - [a link] - [a link] - [a link] - [a link] - [a link] - [a link] - [a link] - [a link]"
881335854,1207,Paul-Licameli,2021-07-16T10:10:54Z,"i have cherry-picked and merged parts of this pull request. i mentioned a few points that are still unresolved, i don't approve the edit cursor change yet, and i must still review all the label track changes. please rebase your branch onto recent master and force-push it again."
970204212,2121,Paul-Licameli,2021-11-16T12:03:11Z,"i pushed a suggested commit, please review that!"
970230294,2121,crsib,2021-11-16T12:35:33Z,"i've left that out to see if i can see a measurable difference in performance and i've observed none. still, that commit is a welcome addition, thank you!"
972513228,2121,Paul-Licameli,2021-11-18T04:07:26Z,"something is definitly wrong with autosave now. do these steps: 1. run audacity; generate noise; force-quit audacity (such as with the debugger) 2. restart audacity; recover files; you should get the noise back. 3. force-quit again; restart again; recover again. expected result: the second recovery works. what i observe: varying crash-y symptoms suggestive of a memory overwrite. i think you must recover twice to get the bug, and i think it happens only starting at the commit ""use the fast stream reader (still, reading from memory)"". of course it may be hard to be sure, when there is a memory overwrite."
972672802,2121,crsib,2021-11-18T09:11:38Z,"there was an issue with recovering a project, that never was saved. i do not observe the issue you described though"
972729744,2121,Paul-Licameli,2021-11-18T10:20:53Z,"which issue? if it happens, it surely is an issue to fix. the unsaved data might be a long recording. i know i saw this problem, and i find it reliably in my macos debug build of this branch, though the exact symptoms are various. i'm not satisfied until there is more understanding."
972739264,2121,Paul-Licameli,2021-11-18T10:33:22Z,"your latest change to loadproject may have made the problem go away, so it seems with a few tries, although i don't know why."
972743450,2121,crsib,2021-11-18T10:38:53Z,"i do not observe any problems with the latest build on macos, not in release or debug builds. i think there can be an issue in showerror"
972767424,2121,Paul-Licameli,2021-11-18T11:11:10Z,"class `xmlutf8bufferwriter` became unused at ""decode bxml directly, without intermediate stage"" so should the class be deleted? sad all that hard work obsoleted so soon."

972773943,2121,crsib,2021-11-18T11:19:49Z,"to be fair, i think it's xmlstringwriter that will go away at some point, and xmlwriter interface will be adapted to match xmlutf8bufferwriter. there is still room for performance gains in serialization, that can be achieved by removing `const wxstring &name` from the writer interface :-) and i expect much easier pr for that!"
972810368,2121,crsib,2021-11-18T12:13:04Z,"well, that was epic!"
833998049,836,falkTX,2021-05-07T01:47:05Z,is this going to be optional / opt-in? integrating an open-source tool with google services will make a lot of people quite unhappy and overall just lose trust on it.
834002118,836,Be-ing,2021-05-07T01:58:41Z,i don't think this sends data to a google server. iiuc breakpad requires the project using it to set up their own server.
834019696,836,Qix-,2021-05-07T02:46:27Z,another :-1: here. why the sudden interest in adding google dependencies for analytics and user tracking?
834031514,836,Picoseconds,2021-05-07T03:15:04Z,"well it's gonna be self-hosted so i'm not sure how bad this is, at least it won't be sending data directly to google"
834077208,836,misyltoad,2021-05-07T05:25:35Z,"i don't see this being particularly useful, automatic crash handlers in oss is a rarity and crashes in software like audacity tend to be pretty easily reproducible as there's not much going on so the gain from getting dumps would be minimal. also can we talk about how this adds 800+ new files? why? importing the breakpad library this way is fucking stupid."
834118315,836,Be-ing,2021-05-07T06:58:55Z,"automatic crash reporting is very useful. most users won't go through the trouble of learning how to use gdb to make a good bug report. but yes, please stop vendoring dependencies. that has collateral impact beyond audacity."
834635280,836,InterVi,2021-05-07T17:20:18Z,can this be turned off?
834648847,836,falkTX,2021-05-07T17:43:58Z,"it is not even on yet. there is no need to turn it off once it is merged though, it can actually be quite useful. i had wrong ideas initially about this, was not sure about implications of using breakpad. this one does not need to rely on google servers. if you really want nothing to do with google, you might as well stop using the web. upcoming quic/http3 is basically a google creation, so the web will be served on a protocol engineered at google."
835305585,836,petersampsonaudacity,2021-05-08T11:19:29Z,if only that were the case - a good example is p1 bug 2700 which was not easily reproducible - and there have been many others over the years (i took over as the main qa tester following the death of gale andrews). and very few users bother to (or even know how to) send crash logs to us sadly.
835371102,836,TOGLK,2021-05-08T13:47:58Z,"i would appreciate a toggle that is built-in to audacity, or, that could be changed prior to compiling audacity, so that end-users can disable this functionality if they wish to do so. i fully understand the importance of crash reporting, and making it automatic helps to streamline the crash report submission process. but. that shouldn't mean that the option to disable such functionality shouldn't be included. i value my privacy and if i decide that i don't want to share crash logs with the audacity development team then that decision should be down to me, and not the developers of audacity. it is my hardware, and my system, and i want to have the choice to decide whether or not my system reports crashes or not. i hope that you will listen to my feedback and consider it quite heavily when deciding how to further proceed with these commits. thank you for taking the time to read what i have to say, and have a good day. toglk."
835382634,836,petersampsonaudacity,2021-05-08T14:22:50Z,"in due course when a build becomes available i will be qa testing this. one thing i will be looking for is an option in the crash report for sending or not sending a crash report. i, for example, almost never send crash reports to microsoft - as i can opt out of that at crash-time (most of mine are deliberate qa crashes anyway to test resilience and recovery - and bug fixes.)"
835384905,836,IGBC,2021-05-08T14:30:26Z,"i am generally pro breakpad. if its between this and #835 i choose this. its library shown to have a lot of benefits. incidentally steam uses it in their client, and i think they have had a lot of success with it."
835388245,836,snoozysoft,2021-05-08T14:41:24Z,"yeah from what i can tell with some brief research, this one actually seems fine since it doesn't appear (on first glance?) to send anything to google. from what i can tell, it requires the developer to have their own server for minidump files to be sent to. ...which begs the question as to why they can't run telemetry stuff on their own servers but *can* run crash reporting stuff. hm. either way, i think the core concern here isn't privacy but stuff more strictly related to the development of audacity itself (which i obviously can't as easily speak for) obviously anything google coming near a foss project is not ideal but as igbc said, if something *must* be added that's bearing that brand name then this is arguably the better one (outside of the ideal option of ""none"" of course)."
835389068,836,IGBC,2021-05-08T14:44:08Z,anyone ever consider this is a bait and switch? they got us angry at analytics so we'd be ok with breakpad :grinning_squinting_face: ?
835389890,836,snoozysoft,2021-05-08T14:46:48Z,"hah, that's a fun thought. i'd agree but this one popped up on the same day only 4 hours after the telemetry pr, which probably isn't enough time besides this is serving a completely different purpose anyway"
835390946,836,IGBC,2021-05-08T14:50:11Z,yea sadly its clear their plan was to install both. clearly they want a near clickstream from this program. its very marketing adjacent. ` `
835395746,836,Paul-Licameli,2021-05-08T15:05:20Z,"please observe that a crash report is sent only if the cmake variable crash_report_url is defined, but it is not defined in this pull request."
835405081,836,crsib,2021-05-08T15:36:52Z,crash reporting will be enabled only for the rc builds. it is technically impossible to do it otherwise anyway. sending the generated crash report will be an opt-in. the report will be sent to the self hosted sentry instance.
835603408,836,IGBC,2021-05-09T00:55:46Z,"why only rc builds, seems like there could be valuable reports out in the wild in release builds. heaven knows the audio world has some wacky machine configurations."
839788875,836,missytake,2021-05-12T13:50:16Z,"and this is exactly why this is a problem - if people can't use the web anymore without using google protocols or software, then we don't have a free and open web anymore. the same is true for my favorite audio editing software. all of my four albums were produced with audacity. there must be a way to get proper crash reports without giving the biggest technology monopoly even more power."
849501934,836,igorkorsukov,2021-05-27T09:57:00Z,"as far as i know, the breakpad is deprecated and will not evolve, for example, it will not support new types of os and processors. so, is recommended to use crashpad [a link]"
849537678,836,vsverchinsky,2021-05-27T10:57:33Z,isn't crashpad distributed under apache license 2.0 (which is incompatible with gplv2)?
849734829,836,igorkorsukov,2021-05-27T15:36:25Z,"got it what the problem is, thank you."
857997823,836,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-09T18:59:31Z,"i'm still asking for fixes for internationalization. among my many comments here, i also suggested improvements in comments, and also the source code tree reorganization (making the crashreporter folder less nested). i would still like those changes, but i won't let them delay approval."

1586174774,4771,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-11T13:51:18Z,don't make pull requests against my fork please. that will only make more confusion. make all pull requests against audacity/audacity and we can have just one conversation page like this one in which we find all related comments all have made. i do not object to force pushes of this evolving project. i still need to change the foundations for you to build on correctly.
1586180008,4771,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-11T14:09:56Z,"general remarks about the new commit ""cachingwidesamplesequence decorator"". i like it better now but still don't want to review it completely. i still think i should continue preparing other foundational work for you to review, and you should rebase onto that, and only then should i do a complete review. at first i was very displeased to see lots of change in audioio.* which will only conflict with the next refactoring i need to do, adding lots of changed lines of code, before i had completely understood the first commit. but now i see the commit comment says that all the changes in mixersource.cpp are reverted. that may be good. i had not yet understood all those changes but i thought it would be better to find a solution that does not change lib-mixer. so really if i haven't understood the first commit fully, i can forget about it, but should instead look at the squash of the two commits. there is now no need for `sampletrackstuff` to be defined in lib-mixer. it can instead be defined in sequence.h. that leaves lib-mixer almost unchanged, but not quite: still you add `getsampletrack` to `widesamplesequence`. i don't like that -- lib-mixer mentioning a class defined in lib-sample-track, which is not one of its dependencies. it compiles, because there is only a forward declaration of the class, but still it is questionable for lower level libraries to mention types defined in higher level libraries. you make lib-audio-io accept the decorated `widesamplesequence` objects constructed at higher levels without needing to know the implementation details. that is goo. but lib-audio-io still depends on `sampletrack`, and therefore, this questionable workaround of `getsampletrack` is needed, to let it find that interface from `widesamplesequence`. remember what i have said: really i want to make lib-audio-io have no dependency on lib-track at all. let me first complete that, so you can review it, then rebase this work onto that. no changes to lib-audio-io should be needed after what i do."
1586761637,4771,saintmatthieu,2023-06-12T07:42:12Z,i admit that it didn't prove helpful.
1600787595,4771,saintmatthieu,2023-06-21T12:57:31Z,this pr is based on #4795. if you wish to review please only those commits with me face :d
1600934935,4771,saintmatthieu,2023-06-21T14:23:12Z,"i compared some aspects of performance before and after this pr: * real-time performance : can play an audacity project with as many as 1024 stereo, 146-second-long tracks without glitches, both before and after this pr. * memory usage : audacity project with 4 stereo., 146-second-long tracks in spectrum display mode. memory requirements decrease by 10% with this pr, from 231 to 212mb."

1096682594,2668,dozzzzer,2022-04-12T12:46:53Z,some issues were observed when testing the solution. - #2808 - #2809 - #2810
1126109738,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-13T14:16:18Z,"linux build is failing, needs `#include ` for std::memmove"
1126993082,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-15T18:34:25Z,this round of review is complete. i am satisfied with the much improved large scale structure of interactions. there are a few must-fix errors. resolve them and this can be approved.
1129734396,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T08:39:52Z,"language change only happens if the user uses the preferences dialog, which can't happen during application initialization. i wouldn't worry. anyway i see you take the acceptably simple way out -- you just use `debug`. still let's remember this discussion. lowering the initialization of locale into some other place in lib- might not be needed yet but lookds easy and like the right thing to do in principle. more generally, many miscellaneous things happening in audacityapp.cpp could use reexamination for movement elsewhere."
1129738181,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T08:43:45Z,"experiment will tell! if ever my separation of modules (not libraries) proceeds, which allows pieces of audacity functionality to be loaded only selectively -- then it might also be easy to suppress the loading of modules at startup time when in the plugin host process, and that would reduce the memory footprint and static initialization code."
1129750205,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T08:55:49Z,but my suggestion was to access members through `lck->` instead of implicitly with captured `this` see `undomanager::enqueuemessage` for an example i wrote

1129765447,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T09:10:48Z,new issue opened. (not yet a necessity for 3.2.)
1129771117,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T09:16:33Z,"shuttlegui was invented to let us avoid worrying about many details in the use of wxwidgets. as i explained, it didn't go far enough for open-endedness, platform neutrality, declarativity, and recombination with generalized variables for holding control values. but, it's a start. anyway might take on the task of rewriting this small dialog with shuttlegui soon."
1129775638,2668,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-18T09:21:01Z,the one conversation i left un-resolved above is the detail about swapping of strings out of `std::optional` in a more efficient way. unimportant. let's merge this! a very satisfying achievement!
1594580102,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-16T12:11:18Z,"as mentioned in the description, this pr is based on -licameli 's current #4746; you may (should) ignore his commits. before going through the commits, i recommend taking a look at `./libraries/lib-stretching-sequence/readme.md`, which presents the rationale for the newly introduced methods in `widesamplesequence` as well as the `lib-stretching-sequence` implementation."
1595728248,4797,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-17T12:12:57Z,"i don't understand all but here are some things to change. - the internal cursor, if really necessary, should be a hidden implementation detail of `stretchingsequence`. - `resetcursor` is called (outside `stretchingsequence`) only in `mixandrender.cpp` immediately after construction. eliminate that. if it isn't needed for export, i think it is also not needed here. - `wavetrack` has no need to override the new functions for the cursors. those overrides are unreachable. - `lib-mixer` should not be changed at all. - the remaining change there after doing the previous is to add `clipinterface`. instead put that in `lib-stretching-sequence`. let `lib-wave-track` depend on that -- in other words, inverting the dependency from what the first attempt did - don't deprecate the overload of `get` taking channel number and buffers. i think it will still be needed for painting code which will still need that pattern of ""channel-major, clip-minor"" access to the data going ""against the grain"" of the new data organization."
1597001838,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-19T11:18:24Z,"thanks paul for your timely review. although possible for this pr, i'd rather not. `mixersource` will need to call this to change position or direction of play when looping (in `mixersource::reposition`) and scrubbing."
1597014552,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-19T11:27:39Z,works for me. done.
1597029740,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-19T11:38:51Z,"i still don't imagine that, after `sampletrackcache` is removed, anything other than `mixersource` will need a continuity of samples across clips. waveform as well as spectrum painting look like they do (or at least could) access data from the clips directly. but i may be wrong, i don't mind removing the deprecation and later remove that method altogether if i turn out to be right. (if i'm right we might not need a `wavetrack` at all anymore. except for some `stretchingsequence` methods that only forward calls to `mwavetrack`, `wavetrack` isn't an interface `stretchingsequence` needs.)"
1597107953,4797,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-19T12:34:04Z,"i dislike any disturbance of lib-mixer interfaces. is it possible to avoid that by letting the decorator instead deduce the need for a change of its cursor from the pattern of access in the `get` calls? but i also dislike the very notion of an internal cursor, unless there is a very strong reason for it. i have not yet reviewed in enough detail to understand the reason. is it because the time stretching algorithm has to maintain some internal state that depends on previous samples?"
1597186205,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-19T13:22:41Z,"yes, the mere action of reading out some output of the time stretcher modifies its state. (hence `getnext` is a non-const method.) i explained the need for a cursor to the best of my ability in this [a link]. i hope this helps convincing you. (hint: look for the ""display the rich diff"" button for that file in github to see the pictures :) )"
1602391119,4797,saintmatthieu,2023-06-22T10:22:22Z,"it is possible, and this is how `stretchingsequence` implements legacy `get`. `getnext` does the maintenance of the read position for the client, so this is done in one place, clients simply cannot use it wrongly and it can be tested once and for all (see call in `section(""resetcursor"", ""reconstructs segment sequence when expected"")`, stretchingsequencetest.cpp). for this reason, after `sampletrackcache` is removed, i'd like `mixersource` to use `getnext`, even if it possibly still could use legacy `get`, and one way or another have the possibility to indicate a change of direction. my hope was that we could also remove legacy `get`, but spectrum display code uses it. (i am skeptical that this is a good thing, though : that code draws spectra clip by clip, and so first asks for clip boundaries before querying the corresponding samples onto the track. i can't see why this wouldn't be possible by just asking samples from the clips themselves, but it's not the time for me to check.) most pragmatic is, at least for now, to leave this api, too."
1608031472,4797,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-26T18:39:55Z,now reconsidering the long commit.
1609870913,4797,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-27T16:36:04Z,"okay, i see my critiques of yesterday mostly resolved to my satisfaction; i reiterated two still unresolved; i added more comments about what was rewritten. i am glad to see you did the work to accomodate the ""channel-major"" access pattern to caches as needed. intermediate commits are not all compilable and free of known bugs (the backwards scrubbing). i won't hold you to the rule. i see nothing yet to delay approval, with just suggestions that you can implement as you wish with a rebase. i still must finish a complete review of the big commit, then likely will approve it."

1203030225,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-02T17:42:35Z,"the latest push looks good, but it awaits completion with step 5. a few comments: - `vsteffectvalidator::mintance` might be private. - i was surprised to see `audiomaster` moved into `vstinstancebase`. i thought at first, that's wrong, it should remain in the wrapper, and the validator may need to use it too. but your comments suggest, we will split the `audiomaster` function into multiple functions, and pass different functions to `pluginmain`. i now think that's a good alternative solution too. - `processblockb ` doesn't need to be separated from `processblock ` as a member function of `vstinstancebase`, now that slaves are also instances. (but not so, yet, for the initialize and finalize functions.) - where is `vsteffectinstance::mnumchannels` used? i can't find it. you might just delete that, and the functions that get and set it. - `callsetchunk` (which has two overloads) is no longer called anywhere! (and the four-argument overload in fact became unused already at commit 2df527f6d72c92c5cf5c8cc679ac6122a03c4649). so, just delete those, and rename the `callsetchunkb` functions as `callsetchunk`. - i think `vstinstancebase::automate` is wrong... i think the `vstinstance` needs to override it, and call `callsetparameter` (not b), and so, the instance needs, transitionally, a reference to the array of slaves. - why is `mtimeinfo` still in the effect class? only the instance and the slaves, also instances, need it. once you address the point about `processblockb`, this will become clearer. remove it from the effect. please do an interactive rebase addressing all of these, force push it, and then proceed to step 5."
1203667942,3278,pietro68,2022-08-03T08:50:35Z,"`mtimeinfo` is actually in the instancebase class, not the effect class; it is referenced by: - `gettimeinfo()` called from the vst callback - `getsamplerate()` called from the vst callback - `vsteffect::vsteffect` as long as the vst callback is called for the effect too, i can not move `mtimeinfo` in the instance only. i actually wonder if i can move it there even after i split the vst callback in two parts (one for the effect, one for the instance) because maybe the callback for the effect will still need to call `gettimeinfo` and/or `getsamplerate`? this because the vst gui might want to draw something that depends on the samplerate (think of a band equalizer for instance)"
1203753452,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-03T10:13:12Z,"i thought we decided it is not needed in the effect. if for gettimeinfo and getsamplerate, the effect can simply inherit the trivial implementations, then mtimeinfo can belong to instance only."
1203804466,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-03T11:09:07Z,"if experiment shows that those cases in audiomaster are not reached for the effect object, but only for the instance, then the simplification of moving mtimeinfo out of effect could be done and would be desirable. but we might leave that until we do such experiment."
1203809495,3278,pietro68,2022-08-03T11:14:33Z,"i'd like to think out loud a bit now. automate is called from the vst callback, sometimes on the effect, sometimes on the instance. i put some breakpoints and i observed this: 1) when instantiating an effect --> `automate` is called on the effect, nothing happens because `mmaster` is null and `mslaves` is empty 2) when moving a slider on the effect gui --> as above 3) when pressing play --> `automate` is called on the instance 4) when clicking ""apply"" (i.e. destructive processing) --> `automate` is called first on the effect (`mmaster`=null `mslaves`={}) and then on the instance 5) when moving a slider while playing --> `automate` is called on the effect, `mmaster`=null but this time `mslaves` has one item my conclusions (but i might be wrong): a) we need both overrides of `automate `(for effect and instance), and when i will split the callback, both of them will need to call `automate `when requested to. b) `mmaster` can be removed (it is always nullptr in my tries above) c) i could do as you say, i.e. pass the array of slaves to the instance and have instance::automate call callsetparameter (not b) on them, but, is it really needed? without this, everything still works and it would be a temporary thing anyway"
1204077864,3278,pietro68,2022-08-03T15:10:13Z,"did a little experiment: using a simple plugin like gain, `gettimeinfo()` is never reached, neither for the effect nor for the instance. but already using an equalizer plugin, at least `gettimeinfo()` is reached, and for the effect only. so i would say, at least `gettimeinfo()` should remain for the effect and return the actual mtimeinfo, and if we want to play it safe, also` getsamplerate()`."
1210864250,3278,pietro68,2022-08-10T15:23:55Z,"a note about my commits for step 5. : i said earlier (and wrote in code comments) that i would split the vst callback function in two parts, one for the instance and one for the effect. since then i changed my mind and opted for a more conservative solution, which is: keep the vst callback in the wrapper and have it call virtual methods. i think doing so is cleaner and poses less risks of breaking things."
1215735182,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-15T20:05:51Z,"i'm still not satisfied. as i explain: both in automate(), and in onslider() (which will both ultimately go to the validator class), callsetparameter should be invoked, but not in `this`, but instead on an instance object. that is the instance stored in the minimal validator class now; and, until the validator is complete, the effect will keep a pointer to the active validator."
1216341317,3278,pietro68,2022-08-16T08:57:28Z,"i can not do this because: 1) `::automate` comes in two versions: - `vstinstancebase::automate` which has no access to members of the effect (such as the pointer to the active validator) - `vsteffect::automate` it is actually calling callsetparameterb 2) i tried doing it in `::onslider`, but then it breaks this functionality: as i move sliders of the plain gui while realtime processing, i do not hear changes in the sound anymore."
1222922394,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-22T20:16:13Z,i am reviewing the latest force-push and so far i am satisfied with the 4.x steps. they can be squashed into one in your next force-push.
1223856907,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-23T10:11:51Z,"please rebase onto latest master, squash steps 4 into one, and squash steps 5 into another commit. address in step 5 the two reqeusts for change. then, this will be approved, and you will move on to the validator."
1223887411,3278,Paul-Licameli,2022-08-23T10:42:19Z,"less important, `muselatency` might also move from wrapper to instance"
1112848203,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-29T03:40:17Z,this completes round one of review!
1112937274,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-29T07:04:32Z,"i have pushed the two promised commits onto this branch. if you rebase and force-push, perhaps they could be moved to the start of the commit sequence so you don't add and old style event handling code for the theme, only to change it again."
1113284121,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-29T13:01:01Z,a third suggested commit added to the branch
1134817786,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-23T15:26:00Z,in fact `tracklist::findbyid` is the convenient thing to use on undo or redo. use `track::getid` to find the value to store in the window.
1135776315,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-24T11:08:12Z,"if the responses to undo and redo appear to work now, without any use of `trackid` or any subscription to undo manager changes, it is because you rely on coindicental track focus change messages -- those send from editmenus.cpp, right? i fell a bit uncomfortable with that. it seems a bit fragile, and it might be preferable that this panel should express its dependency on the current undo state directly, even if it requires a little more work. you are depending on things coded in editmenus.cpp for this window to work correctly, but the src/menus files should be tops of the dependency graph -- they depend on other things, but nothing depends on them. this isn't ""dependency"" in the really hard sense of link time, but dependency in a weaker sense. i might not insist on this fix to get this merged and testable. but i'm not wholly satisfied without it."
1135802233,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-24T11:37:58Z,"i pushed a small commit 93b60966a10d36998a990e467cd5d115b1e9d170 onto the branch, in case my point about a pure virtual having definition was unclear. this completes another round of review. i hope this converges today into something we merge and let qa test."
1135806963,2867,Paul-Licameli,2022-05-24T11:43:07Z,"one more thing -- did you resolve the point, that a click on the ""[add] effects"" button should reset the track focus? i don't see where that omission was fixed."

801662932,759,serkan-maker,2021-03-18T06:20:06Z,"hello, i corrected some incorrect translations. i did not make much change in the current translation. the majority was to add accelerators. i fixed the translation of the most parts. i would appreciate it if you report the mistake i made, i would be considered a novice in the translation business. there are also 270 missing translation lines that are not in the .pot file but are available in the interface. these missing lines are present in the .po file but cannot be used.

1235329701,3432,crsib,2022-09-02T10:23:18Z,there will be additional changes added
1235333843,3432,Paul-Licameli,2022-09-02T10:28:03Z,"ok, i'll merge my two little prs rather than yield to you now"
1235621511,3432,Paul-Licameli,2022-09-02T15:15:24Z,"the hidden dependency is broken, so mod-pcm etc. might still be extracted -- good. the configuration of preferred types is stored in lib-cloud-audiocom and not in the ui layer. ok. otherwise i'm not sure i understand the other objections to my draft solution, or why there is an essential difference. why would it be so wrong in principle to combine the two abstract interfaces if in future the exportplugin interface could be demoted into a library too? the concrete implementations of exportplugin and associated cloudexporterplugin end up side-by-side anyway. and it's not even necessary, for cycle breaking, to demote the new cloudexporterplugin interface into a library. lib-cloud-audiocom depends on lib-cloud-upload -- but really only for mimetypeslist which is just a few type aliases. i don't know quite what you mean about the existing exporter framework being so difficult to rewrite. it is true that it has its own ""statefulness"" problem much like effects. each particular exporter has a set of global variables for preferred settings. is there some great need for a menu of ""presets"" for each exporter? would we store those in std::anys? ... finally my foolish question, why can't any file format you like be uploaded to cloud, then downloaded again to another audacity executable that can interpret the same format? why can't we have open-endedness here? i don't understand the technical limitation that the server would impose againt it."
1235702193,3432,crsib,2022-09-02T16:34:22Z,"well, this is wrong ... in principle. for example, it breaks isp, which is i in solid. i do not like the implementation i proposed either, but provided the current framework it will have to stay for now. hopefully, it would be removed one day. exportplugin should know nothing about the possibility of audio uploads. uploading is an optional feature. uploading depends on exporting, not vice versa. i can easily see how we need to extend those interfaces based on user testing, i do not want to change exportplugin interface to do that. you are correct, that implementations reside close to the plugins now, but that is not because i like it there. there is simply no other feasible options right now. to be fair i had never seen usage of `any` that solved problems instead of introducing ones. scripting language binding, commonly referred as a `good example`, are not using `any`. scripting languages have a very well defined set of types and bindings must know how to map the specific host language type into a scripting language type. `any` has virtually no use there. python has a stronger type system than c, so to speak. speaking of exporter configuration i am afraid that ffmpeg approach is the ""nessecary evil"". that is - we have a string identifier mapping a well defined variant, with values checked by a plugin for validity. plugin, on the other hand, provides a list of supported options with the constraints on them, so the ui can be built. using `any` as a configuration will not allow interface clients to supply configuration to the plugin unless we link against a specific plugin. however, i like the presets idea very much. audio.com is an audio sharing service. that is - it needs to know how to play and how to transcode the uploaded audio ."
1235719425,3432,Paul-Licameli,2022-09-02T16:54:46Z,"i'm not sure i understood all of the previous. std::any is surely a dangerous escape into typelessness, unlike std::variant, and not to be overused, but it does allow open-endedness as variant does not. i think it is the right tool for the job in the system of effects. there are ""producers"" of anys (effects doing makesettings) and ""consumers"" that can interpret them (instances) but in between a custodian that ""warehouses"" them (realtimeeffectstate). the middleman needs to belong to a lower level of the dependency graph, and not need to know a closed-ended variant of possibilities, which would violate ""d"". the middleman's job is to guarantee only that it gives the right anys back to the right parties that ask to use them and know how to interpret them."
1235744930,3432,crsib,2022-09-02T17:24:56Z,"i do not agree, but i though we agreed to disagree here :-) there are significant limitations that will make implementing certain features expensive or not possible. on top of that, it makes debugging hard. so we are not on the same page here as well. (think of any feature that needs a list of parameters!) i'm not sure how d will be violated, but l is violated right now. d, as in dependency inversion, is very strict on l. otherwise it is impossible to make the system safe. i am not convinced yet that this middleman itself is needed and there is definitely no need for it in exporters :-) using similar approach for exporters will not solve the issue we are discussing right now."
1235764887,3432,Paul-Licameli,2022-09-02T17:50:41Z,i don’t understand what alternative you would suggest for the system of effects. effectsettings may have been stretched for too many purposes that should be separated — yes. the inter-thread communication could be simpler. i have ideas for that i would like to do next release. still see the need for real-time effect state to store some polymorphic data for the related stateless effect object to interpret and serialize and deserialize.
1235773417,3432,crsib,2022-09-02T18:01:52Z,"this just means, that stateless effect is not serializable, the statefull effectinstance is. quite a complex topic to discuss on a train using a phone. can we discuss it sometimes later please?"
934524358,1193,Paul-Licameli,2021-10-05T15:40:07Z,"thank you, edward. the merging of this work was done, but not using the github interface to do it."
1271882058,1193,tank-trax,2022-10-07T17:54:22Z,how does this work? i can't find any spectral data control panel

1272054881,1193,Paul-Licameli,2022-10-07T20:18:12Z,"please do. sorry, i'll get that fixed in the next-release branch."
1611474835,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-28T14:03:06Z,this pr is based on currently-in-qa [a link]
1611482097,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-28T14:07:14Z,"message of second commit: whoever implements the listener must be able to use the `tracklist` to make sure all tracks of a project get the update, and to make sure newly added tracks also get the project tempo set. since lib-track and lib-numeric-format do not depend on one another, i have the source code itself implement the listener. my first approach during the early poc days was to have `lib-wave-track` depend on `lib-numeric-format`. it was a request from -licameli that i avoid this dependency and we came up with this solution. i still am not convinced that it is the wisest choice, though, since it comes at the cost of rather lots of synchronization code. also, at it stands i implement `projecttempolistenerinterface` in `src` itself, which means more work for the qt migration i suppose?"
1611596798,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-28T14:54:16Z,"actually, i'm questioning the need for this pr at all. `waveclip` has a stub `setprojecttempo` not doing anything yet. what will happen in future? you will store a `double`? is the intention that `waveclip`s will default their tempo to the project tempo, unless otherwise changed by the user for the individual clip? but why not simply store `optional `? you understand we can't have `wavetrack` or `waveclip` store back-pointers to the project or any attachment of the project, because copy-paste across projects would then have dangling pointers. but in all places where it matters to retrieve the clip ratio, arrange to supply the value from the project as context information. for instance, the stretching sequence decorator can be constructed with that value. `stretchingsequence::create` is now used in three places. in two, there is a `tracklist` available that can be queried for its project. the third is in `mixandrender` and the two callers of that have a `tracklist` so it would not be hard to add one argument for the value."
1611607857,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-28T15:00:55Z,"or put this another way -- can you make a bigger pr? show me how `waveclip::getstretchratio` becomes a real function and not just the stub returning 1.0 always. then i'd say, change it to take default tempo as an argument, figure out all other necessary changes in `lib-stretching-sequence` to supply that argument, and then working up the call stack, you would arrive at the uses of `stretchingsequence::create`. then maybe all this effort with publishers and listeners won't be needed, and we will have one less consistency invariant in the data structures that we would need to worry about preserving."
1612018981,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-28T19:55:59Z,"the stretch ratio (not only clip-specific, but that which takes project tempo into account too) isn't only needed during playback, but also for painting. and we must care to look at up-to-date project tempo values, too. that said, playback assumes constant project tempo (we want to disable the possibility of tempo change during playback), so your suggestion would probably work in this case. as for the painting, it's all in `src`, so yeah, looks like an up-to-date project tempo value can be queried for each painting pass. i'll try it out."
1612035927,4853,crsib,2023-06-28T20:09:58Z,"constant tempo during the playback is not the design choice, we just had no time to make the tempo and time signature variable. and even with tempo being constant for the whole project duration, i am not sure that changing the tempo during the playback is disabled now or should be disabled in the future. i haven't looked through the pr yet, so i don't know why there is a need for another publisher."
1612057316,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-28T20:28:15Z,"i can't think of anything ux-wise that should prevent tempo change during playback, but even with more time it seems to me that the implementation cost is not worth the additional convenience for the user. in any case, yes, we don't have time in this iteration. i believe this was mentioned during stand-up, there seemed to be a consensus that tempo change could be disabled during playback, and no one mentioned it should be done on the longer term. you'd be the first :)"
1612233455,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-28T23:23:47Z,tempo change during playback might raise the problem of proper updates without race conditions when a worker thread needs to query the tempo. maybe `getstrerchratio` needs a context type that will contain a constant double in a first version but a virtual function to get the varying tempo in future and the override could use atomics.
1612331811,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-29T02:11:47Z,see also the trackartist structure and uses of trackartist::get. that's how other context information can be got into drawing routines. see trackpanel::drawtracks where things are set up in this context.
1612718918,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-29T09:39:45Z,"trying the project-tempo-passed-as-argument-when-needed approach ... there's a difficulty, that could be worth tackling. `waveclip` boundary getters and setters (`getplaystarttime`, `setsequencestarttime`, etc) use _seconds_. now consider situations such as this one : 1. user moves clip, which updates its boundary member variables. 2. user changes tempo. 3. painting wants to paint, which requires clip to report its time boundaries. the correct value would be `boundaryinseconds * tempowhenboundarywasset / currenttempo`. where do we get `tempowhenboundarywasset` ? possible approaches: * publisher approach: like i've been doing so far: each project tempo change is published to clip, which modifies its boundaries accordingly. this requires this pr. * projecttimesignature approach: similar to the publisher approach, except `lib-wave-track` depends on `lib-numeric-format`. * beat approach: clip boundaries are expressed in beats, as well as all its public methods. | | pros | cons | |--- | ------------- | ------------- | | **publisher** | * proven to work * likely fastest delivery | * need to maintain up-to-date values * rounding errors might build up (each tempo change implies a `*=` operation on those time values) | | **projecttimesignature** | * no need for a ""new publisher"" | * need to pass correct reference when copy-pasting, c.f. `sampleblockfactory` * maintenance of clip time boundaries is still needed | | **beat** | * clips don't worry about tempo changes * consistent with ui : project tempo changes modify position in time view, not b&m view -> might have unforeseen positive side-effect | * clients must know project tempo when asking these values (may not be a bad thing) * compatibility | **explanation about the compatibility problem of the beat approach** : old audacity projects store boundary-related clip member variables in seconds. to convert them in beats, the project tempo must be known. this information, available somewhere in the project file, will have to be communicated to the clip. backward compatibility (opening 3.4+ projects with older versions), if deemed important, could also be achieved by saving time values, in which case project tempo at save time will also have to be communicated. i have a goodish feeling about the beat approach. i'll give it a try, at least until new feedback arrives."
1613117496,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-29T12:46:01Z,my understanding of “beats” is that you normalize out any tempo information when modifying the clip. then only current tempo is needed. i think that may work better. maybe this pr should be closed and you will propose another that really stores new information in clips so i can better understand the whole.
1613313492,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-29T14:46:10Z,modifying the project tempo also counts as clip modification (its boundaries).
1613361585,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-29T15:13:51Z,closing this pr for now makes sense until new developments.
1613515366,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-29T16:43:18Z,"it's quite thrilling ... hard to formulate simply and convincingly, even to myself. i think key to understand the problem is indeed that _one tempo change is all it takes_ to invalidate clip boundaries. _beats_ remain constant, seconds don't. imagine: 1. hey clip, set start time to 60s. 2. i'm going to change project tempo now ... 3. hey clip, what's your start time again ? clip cannot tell, unless it knows by how much the project tempo has changed between. it is _not_ sufficient (-licameli) for the client to know tempo in step 3 : the answer differs if all three following examples: a) tempo was 60bpm in 1 and is now 120bpm in 3 => answer is 30s b) tempo was 120 and is now 60 => answer is 120s c) tempo was 120 and is now 240 => answer is 30s. i've said this already earlier: the publisher approach makes sure that the tempo is known at any time, which enables giving the correct answer without changing the `waveclip` boundary-related methods - and there's many of them: * getsequencestarttime * setsequencestarttime * getplaystarttime * setplaystarttime * getplayendtime * setplayendtime * settrimleft * gettrimleft * settrimright * gettrimright * trimleft * trimright * trimleftto * trimrightto * offset * withinplayregion * beforeplaystarttime * afterplaystarttime i don't think i can give a better impression of what any alternative to the proposal in this pr would look like in terms of size. i, personally, would still prefer to have clips store their boundaries in beats. it might hurt now, but could bring good after."
1613532118,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-29T16:57:01Z,"we must choose between the pain of redundant data stored in each clip, with the problems of invalidation. or the pain of changing all of those functions to accept ""wave clip context"", but then, boundaries become computed. i still feel inclined toward the second pain. once it is done, ""wave clip context"" can also be enlarged to carry other information, and we won't need other publishers and listeners."
1613540105,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-29T17:02:48Z,"maybe the first will look like the lesser short-term pain, after all, but my intuition is that the second would be better for longer term maintainability."
1613541601,4853,crsib,2023-06-29T17:04:06Z,"do we need a context other than audacityproject, though? i don't quite understand the problem now; i will chat with tomorrow."
1613693798,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-29T19:37:12Z,"the context we need is `projecttimesignature`, an attachment to the audacity project in `lib-numeric-format`. that dependency graph node and `lib-wave-track`, where this context need is seen for the first time, have no inter-dependency, and -licameli is reluctant in establishing one."
1613725844,4853,DavidBailes,2023-06-29T19:52:15Z,at least some daws seem to have options for the timebase. eg: [a link] [a link] is the plan for audacity not to have such options? or have i misunderstood what you have written?
1613732428,4853,crsib,2023-06-29T19:57:16Z,"as i understand, the primary concern of paul is that we cannot store any references to audacityproject in the clips due to copy/paste implementation details. this concern is very convincing :-)"
1613764561,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-29T20:23:37Z,"that was a concern in 's prototype efforts. it's not my concern now, with this or the alternative proposals. a context passed whenever some computed result is needed allows the clip not to store a reference to the context object. but as said i don't like accumulating unnecessary dependencies. a context, which is not audacityproject& or any object within it, can itself be computed as needed upstairs in src/, where wide dependencies are acceptable, and passed by value as a struct. a problem is getting that context into all the right places must disturb much code. but the alternative of pushing redundant copies of project tempo information into each clip whenever there is a change -- seems questionable too, increasing the problems of keeping project data consistent."
1614234791,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-30T07:17:07Z,"there is the possibility of passing the correct `projecttimesignature` as argument to clip copy constructors, the way it already is done with `sampleblockfactory`. for the sake of completeness i'll add this option to the table."
1614253818,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T07:35:11Z,"i am strongly opposed to this solution. it will make audacity fragile and hard to extend, it immediately makes a new non-ui feature in audacity not available to qt. the dependence of `waveclip` (or rather of any `track`) on tempo is explicitly specified in product design. it can be made implicit in code, indeed, but this sounds like an enormous source of errors more than anything else. previously, when the need for such context occurred, you pushed hard against it and i agreed with you. i don't honestly understand how is this case different."
1614303424,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-30T08:18:58Z,"trying to understand your concern, please correct me if i'm wrong. you mean `waveclip` storing boundaries (`mtrimleft`, `msequenceoffset`, etc.) as beats rather than seconds, implying tempo must be specified for these to become convertible to seconds and sample indices. could you give a concrete example? so far the identified places where `src` would have to pass the project tempo information is when the transport tracks are constructed for playback and rendering, as well as where painting (waveform and spectrum) is needed. aren't these places where tempo will be available, whether now or in qt?"
1614323965,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T08:36:14Z,"no. why? i'm talking about introducing some external generic context with ""all we need to calculate the boundaries, drawing, and everything"". like `trackpaneldrawingcontext`, which is so generic that it even has a `void*` ""user data"" field! does it remove the dependency on tempo? it does not. playback will be lifted from the `src` tree, and drawing won't. where should we fill this ""externalized"" context? what should we do when the context extends? and we anticipate that it will extend. otherwise, we could just pass ""tempo"" value. but we have an example with effects already where we cannot have beats display because initially, we pass only the sample rate instead of a more general context."
1614343885,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-30T08:52:47Z,"this objection is not strong. it may only mean that the place where the context is built is not yet extracted into a higher level library. the library extraction effort is paused to get all this other work done. i would like to avoid lib-wave-track depending on more things. what if i concede that? then audacityproject& is enough context. design specifies desired program behavior. it does not specify any such implementation choice. remind me what you refer to. anyway if context is not used, and a “push” of tempo info into each clip really must be done, then a roundabout way of doing it as in the closed pr will be needed. but i can’t approve this pr without seeing and understanding more of the whole, and whether the alternative really makes more sense."
1614364953,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T09:07:03Z,"i refer to #4414 it explicitly depends on `lib-project-rate-interface` already. i understand your concern about `lib-numeric-format`, but i can easily extract projecttimesignature into another library. i don't expect that it will take more than 30 minutes. nor do i. we are very aligned on this. behavior specifies an explicit dependency on tempo. it can be hidden by introducing a transfer object of some kind (call it context), but it does not remove this dependency. failing to correctly specify the tempo will result in an error."
1614366498,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-30T09:08:20Z,"oh, ok. my concern for now is limited to tempo context. i still am not 100% sure that this is also something you see a problem with. you mention real-time effects, but i'm not too concerned that these need project tempo information."
1614369512,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T09:10:48Z,"they do, regardless of the time stretch. we cannot allow using bars/beats for the duration in generators because they cannot access the time signature and tempo. there are plans, currently on hold, to fix that."
1614397756,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-30T09:34:50Z,do you refer to my attempts to define effectcontext? the recently reviewed raii object for temporary effect output tracks was spun off from that other effort to remove state from effectbase.
1614400307,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T09:36:57Z,exactly!
1614406714,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-30T09:42:13Z,"maybe that will after all look like the least difficult thing, if more dependency from lib-wave-track is allowed. but consider what i asked elsewhere about maybe under specified behavior of other kinds of tracks."
1614412228,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-30T09:47:03Z,"are you two thinking of the same thing? i think matthieu refers to the playback, not the ui, and for that we have the stretching decorator encapsulating the time stretch calculations."
1614412771,4853,crsib,2023-06-30T09:47:33Z,"absolutely, let's raise it at the meeting today!"
1614415043,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-30T09:49:27Z,i will be climbing a mountain now that there’s finally some good weather here
1615194636,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-06-30T21:04:31Z,"trying out the beat approach. it turns out to be a very healthy exercise, insofar as it reveals that some methods now make little sense ... time values cannot index to specific positions in tracks or clips anymore without a tempo specified. it'd be like asking when a given sample must be played out without knowing the speed of the cursor. for clips, we still can have methods like `get(samplecount start, size_t length)`, since the left-trimmed part is actually a fraction of the raw data. we ignore that fraction of the raw samples, and start from there, reading unstretched, raw data. tracks are the arrangement of clips onto a timeline with beat units. as such, they _must_ return stretched data : it wouldn't make sense for the ui to show clip a lasting 1s, and then having it produce 2s worth of samples. `get(samplecount start, size_t len, ...` and the likes should therefore be banned from non-stretching-capable tracks. so, `wavetrack::get` : gone. (or `assert(false)` for now if it ever gets used.) `stretchingsequence` can stretch, so that's fine. the other is `cachingplayablesequence` : i think this whole class should be gone. without its `get` method it serves little purpose. the spectrum-display code should query the raw data on the clips directly (and stretch the display), using the `getsampleview` method the way `cachingplayablesequence` has been doing to ensure caching works. and then come destructive effects... on the one end, there's a `widesamplesource`, calling `wavetrack::get`, and on the other, a `widesamplesink`, calling `wavetrack::set`, with a per-track effect instance in between. i've argued already that `get` should go. `set` should go for the same reasons. what i think makes most sense instead is to have those source and sink classes handle clips directly too, in their order of appearance on the timeline, read _all_ samples (including those trim-hidden), process them, and write them back. silence is ignored in between, leading to clip a possibly ringing into clip b, but ringing already happens in a not very convincing way ux-wise. i'm not finished yet with that experiment. let's hope there are no more hurdles for it to reveal. paul pointed out the label-track case today, which also are arrangement of objects on a timeline now with beat units, though..."
1615338747,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T01:26:23Z,"eliminating wavetrack::get and wavetrack::set, and making mixer aware of clip boundaries, are radical ideas that i dont like. i need persuading."
1615589796,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T07:23:12Z,"what are you assuming about conservation of clip structure when rendering or applying a destructive effect? what was specified by the design team? mix and render has never preserved it. existing destructive effects do not do it consistently. if that change is not your idea alone but the design teams, i am very unhappy to learn about it now. i am thinking of implications and i don’t like them. but wavetracksink is not even used for all destructive effects, only those that inherit pertrackeffect. whatever you think you will accomplish by these changes will not apply to all destructive effects. i oppose changes for rendering too. rendering for export should be oblivious to clips, but just take streams of samples to mix into an audio file, which doesn’t have clips, and that means keeping the simple abstraction of sources. mixing and rendering to a track should not behave differently. it should give you the as-if-exported sound but still in a track. clip boundaries are lost."
1615593186,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T07:29:02Z,"i have a growing suspicion that we have fundamentally erred in assuming all time stretch should apply upstream of stacked effects. it seems to be creating too many problems. doing tempo stretch downstream, for drawing and playback and rendering, might cut through some problems. the stretch determined by clip handles could be a separate upstream stretch. yes, drawing of clips may need to avoid wavetrack::get, fetching straight from clips and taking the handle drag into account. but now i think tempo should be a separate thing, also in drawing context, available in drawing routines of all track types. mixing for export should also apply the tempo stretch as the last processing stage. mixing and rendering would omit that, so that the rendered track as played is exactly what would result from exporting the tracks instead. but i don’t see how to get this property if tempo stretch is upstream instead. time stretch for tempo would need to be done in audioio. that’s a lot of work messing with what is fed into those ring buffers. maybe multiple levels of ring buffers are needed! i’ll think of something. (do we also want dynamic variation of tempo during playback? more headache.) the problems of get and set in pertrackeffect may be unimportant because the sources and sinks are really sequential, not random access. wavetrack::set needs to exist still to implement the pencil tool, or maybe a direct waveclip::set. you zoom in until you see samples (though now some stretch is applied in drawing them), and you edit them directly. where wavetrack::set is still used in destructive effects, leave it alone. i don’t want universal preservation of clip structure suddenly imposed as a new surprise requirement. tempo stretch seems to me to want to be a high level project wide thing that is applied in the right contexts, and can be kept out of waveclip or any other track subtype."
1615689796,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T08:30:21Z,"behavior relating to clip preservation would change in neither mix-and-rendering, export nor destructive effects. `widesequencesource` and `widesequencesink` would now deal with clips directly (or `clipinterface`, or whichever few methods they need from clips) and not with a `widesamplesequence`. their implementation wouldn't need to know where clips are on the ui representation, but could just process them one after the other, ignoring silence in between. this process would change the _contents_ of the clips, but not affect their _boundaries_ on tracks."
1615691102,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T08:31:46Z,"in the case of destructive effects, no stretching comes in to play."
1615705262,4853,crsib,2023-07-01T08:39:26Z,"mix-and-render changes the clip boundaries by design (effectively by creating a single clip, dropping attached effects etc), i don't think that it is wise to change this behavior. probably i don't understand you correctly. fwtiw playback, rendering, and export could be viewed as the same process, but with different sinks, and for mix&render the sink is just a track. i am a bit confused. i don't think that there are commutative properties in effect application. wouldn't it make a destructive application result to be very different in some cases?"
1615720170,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T08:45:14Z,"by destructive effects i've been meaning selecting a track, choosing an effect and applying it. this preserves clip boundaries now, and it still would with my suggestion."
1615741826,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T08:59:27Z,"say you have a clip and stretch it by a ratio of 2. now apply an effect. there are two possibilities: 1. render an un-stretched clip : apply the effect a it is now, on the raw data. the result is still a clip with stretch ratio metadata 2. 2. render a stretched clip : apply the effect and stretch (or the other way round). the result is a clip with stretch ratio metadata 1. i have been suggesting 1. it is more conservative : stretch a clip by 2, apply gain, unstretch : it's as though you had never stretched. also, the sources and sinks used wouldn't need to have time-stretchers injected. does that un-confuse you?"
1615762061,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T09:12:55Z,"design team’s requirements or your ideas? i suspect a lot of surprising consequences are not well thought out, such as the overlapping of clips, and restructuring every destructive effect to work this way is a bad surprise implying a lot of work no one budgeted."
1615771981,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T09:19:48Z,"i think we need to separate clip stretching from project tempo, and do one, only one, of them well in this release. i have a growing alarm about overreach. i think tempo is the more valued thing, but my efforts have all been to support clip stretching. i think downstream application of tempo stretch is the right thing for various reasons, but the alternative was not given proper early consideration."
1615773210,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T09:21:40Z,"and doing it downstream means messing with the data communicated between threads in audioio, and that is the large problem i should be figuring out. (and fixing the outstanding latency problems with it.)"
1615803665,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T09:49:36Z,"i don't see how this could be design's idea. the behavior doesn't change, whether with stretched clips or not."
1615842180,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T10:41:26Z,"so it’s not a requirement, it’s your own idea, but you are incorrect that separately applied effects on each clip would give equivalent results for all effects. what does reverb do it you select a clip and some empty space after it?"
1615854396,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T11:14:24Z,this: ![a link]
1615861652,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T11:35:33Z,"... but that with delay: ![a link] that's new to me. i'm not too concerned that the source now has to know how much silence there is between each clip, but it also makes me realize that the parameters of timing-based effects (such as this one, a delay) must account for the stretch ratio. that'd need to be done on each timing-related effect one by one, would only (?) be a parameter change, but it may have other consequences. the alternative, indeed, is to do have the source apply time stretching - not the sink! or the effect's timing is messed up just as much. couldn't that work with a `stretchingsequence` ?"
1615865653,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T11:42:34Z,"try it again, with a silent clip touching the other clip on the right."
1615867694,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T11:47:22Z,"but i don’t like the ideas i’m hearing. im increasingly thinking the entire project needs a rethink. my refactorings for wide wave clips and tracks are not wasted work, and the new caching was not either, but i have doubts now whether the stretching decorator is right. downstream application of time stretch seems better to me. why wasn’t it considered? maybe because doing it upstream was easier to figure out for a convincing prototype. doing it down may need other less obvious work but the alternative should be considered."
1615880783,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T12:15:58Z,"the reverb of a leaks into b. so would it with the clip-by-clip approach i propose, as well as with a `stretchingsequence` used by the source."
1615881093,4853,crsib,2023-07-01T12:17:00Z,"i'm not sure that a follow the terminology, but i think that the stretching should happen before any other effect. probably i'm wrong, can you please help with this?"
1615883998,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T12:22:10Z,"i'd say so too. timing-related effects would need to anticipate stretching to produce the wanted result. take slap-back echo, for example. apply it first, and stretch after, and you've stretched the slap-back time. or the effect would have to compensate for stretching upstream, which sounds ugly."
1615885540,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T12:28:33Z,you were one step ahead of me. later in this conversation i was writing sounds like a rule of thumb.
1615885627,4853,Tantacrul,2023-07-01T12:28:55Z,"i can't imagine applying time stretching after effects. as and say, it seems sensible for it to be first in the chain."
1615887337,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T12:34:35Z,"to be complete, possible would also be to time-stretch downstream of `wavetrack`, with a time-stretcher which changes its ratio on the fly. the effects would still come after, and we wouldn't have had the joint-stereo problem. i still feel better on a clip-based stretching instance, though, and have the guarantee that timing at the start of a clip doesn't depend on the stretcher's output until then. -licameli this was the main reason driving me to suggest this approach from the start."
1615909162,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T13:26:11Z,"one argument for applying tempo stretch last: if you export, time stretch is applied in the resulting audio file. if you mix and render, you should get a track that plays back exactly as the exported audio. that means: we should precompute everything except the tempo stretch, because playback will apply it. this may not be possible if the stretch applies first in export."
1615915006,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T13:30:46Z,then i do not understand the proposal.
1615917673,4853,crsib,2023-07-01T13:33:59Z,is it what happens now? then i would call it bug and fix it.
1615923336,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T13:48:30Z,"i mean i assume it would happen and be a feature. whatever you play in audacity should be what goes into the export. we do that for the stacked effects, and would do it too for stretch. now honestly let me counter argue myself: if tempo stretch applies before other stacked effects, then a solution is that mix-and-render also applies the inverse of project tempo stretch as the last stage of transformation before re-storing the samples. then playback inserts tempo stretching upstream, which cancels this."
1615926710,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T13:53:16Z,"but the counter counter is this: are we really sure that applying stretch by ratio r, then again by 1/r, is really an identity transformation in this implementation?"
1615928055,4853,crsib,2023-07-01T13:55:41Z,"i'm not sure i follow. mix-and-render, similar to playback, similar to export, applies time stretch first. however the resulting track (and it's single clip) is not time stretched. why do we need to do the reverse transform? yes, it will become very complicated when we allow to set the tempo curve, but right now this is not the case."
1615937957,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T14:19:51Z,"isn’t the project tempo stretch applied to all tracks? then if rendered tracks, being in the same project, have had the tempo stretched baked into the data, the playback will insert the tempo stretch again unless somehow the rendered track cancels it."
1615942630,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T14:36:22Z,on the other other hand... a solution can be that every clip stores what the project tempo was at the time it was created. the stretch ratio depends on that and the current project tempo. or was that the idea all along? i was foolish then.
1615949531,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T14:54:59Z,"whatever we do decide, stretching before or after effects — i want to know that designers considered the alternatives and really have a strong preference, or are decidedly neutral about it and will leave it to development to choose an implementation. it seems it is not so: that martin is only now answering the question, and matthieu did not consider alternatives or is acting on assumptions about which is better, that i’m not persuaded of. if design is neutral, then i dislike matthieu’s proposals as introducing unnecessary complexities we might avoid. if design is not neutral, and at least some of these complexities are unavoidable, very well, we must accept them and make things work."
1615965992,4853,crsib,2023-07-01T15:41:10Z,"i think martin has strongly asserted that time stretching should be applied first. i don't think that it makes sense to do it other way around. i feel that this oversight is similar to one with effect settings window modality. it was assumed to be obvious so it never was explicitly stated. for sample tracks, the amount of stretch is a property of a clip. within a track clips can have different stretching coefficients."
1615975218,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T16:02:49Z,"maybe it’s obvious to others. but i’d like martin to speak for himself. i may not understand the use cases. what i do know is that if project tempo can be applied after all else, then it can cut through a lot of implementation difficulty. (ignore what i said about render and export: i now think that can work with either choice.) this is not the same problem as stretching each clip by a different adjusted ratio. and i want to ask again, whether we should commit to doing only one of these in this release — either tempo adjustment (which was the purpose stated in this pr title) or clip adjustment (which is not) — in case we can’t solve all the difficulties of both on time."
1615977581,4853,Tantacrul,2023-07-01T16:12:29Z,"to avoid the risk of committing to a course of action without fully agreeing (because i, for one might miss something), i'd suggest we have a little chat early next week. when talking about real-time effects, it's not very valuable to apply ts at the end of the effects chain. this is a production thing. if someone here is discussing destructive effects, then i worry there's some use case (or technical weirdness in audacity) i've failed to consider."
1616015844,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T17:39:00Z,"so, destructive effects were not a topic in those design meetings yet that i skipped? i want so say: identify known problems with timing dependent destructive effects, to fix in next release. there is worrying scope creep getting discussed here, here dissipating our limited efforts. get all the other fundamentals done. leave destructives alone to behave however they will for this release."
1616034162,4853,Tantacrul,2023-07-01T18:17:30Z,let's chat. the last thing i want to do is accidentally give the impression that some large chunk of work now needs to be done.
1616051900,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T19:00:10Z,"time-stretching a clip by a factor of 2 and then again by a factor of 2 yields a result different from time-stretching that clip once by a factor of 4. likewise, -licameli, since you asked: stretching by 2 and then by 0.5 doesn't restore the original. quality suffers from each pass. our time-stretcher may be excellent, it's not perfect : there still is some amount of widening and smearing. therefore, the approach we're undertaking is the best from a quality point of view. each clip's stretch ratio is the product of its individual stretch ratio (modifiable with the handles) and of the ratio `originaltempo / projecttempo`, allowing only just one time-stretching pass. -licameli this pr is only just about bringing the project tempo information to the clips. their own, ""handle"" stretch ratio is easy to get - that's the ticket we planned for vitaly."
1616052669,4853,saintmatthieu,2023-07-01T19:03:02Z,what is `originaltempo`? -licameli you guessed right : it's the project tempo when the clip is dropped. it is on the roadmap (at least informally) to improve this by reading tempo metadata or detecting is by analyzing the signal.
1616053994,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-01T19:08:23Z,"yes, i didn’t raise the question of repeated stretching causing degraded quality but i thought of it. stretching for project tempo and for handles should be adjacent in the stack of processing, whether upstream or down, and combined into one. i was thinking about how to implement it all downstream, very differently from the stretching decorator. but if that really is a non-starter from a design standpoint , okay forget it. reopen this pull request, under a new number so we can restart the conversation thread. put more in it if you can — enough that i see what new data a waveclip really stores and updates."
1616599710,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-02T10:59:11Z,"about the problems of destructive effects: i emphasize again, do not attempt a solution as you outlined it. i think too many individual built in effects will need too much rewriting. it will distract from more fundamental problems of this feature that are still not moving through review and test. it will likely conflict with many of the other rewrites i’m trying to do to support joint stereo. but i did have an idea for an alternative solution that i want to explain..."
1616600761,4853,Paul-Licameli,2023-07-02T11:04:15Z,"whenever an effect or other editing operation must paste into a wavetrack, map the given time to the correct clip. then first transform that clip with time stretch, and reset its stored stretch information to unit stretch ratio. then proceed as in old code. i think this way would be more local in code modifications of class wavetrack, will not disturb its interface, and will leave much other code undisturbed. do similar with set() except for the pencil tool."
1002200367,2224,LWinterberg,2021-12-28T17:06:40Z,"hello , are you planning to continue work on this?"
1002220837,2224,Subhra264,2021-12-28T18:00:43Z,"hello, sorry, i know that i am late( i had no idea about audio channels, samples, sample rate etc. so had to study it first), but i am still working on it.. the `importwavpack.cpp` file is almost ready, except the `importwavpackfilehandle::import` function which is partly complete. for example i pushed all the `channels` to `outtracks`. but it's taking time because ~i am not sure what to do with the `samplesread` decoded with `wavpackunpacksamples` as in the `importflac.cpp` file, i saw that channels were directly pushed to `outtracks`, but in `importogg.cpp` file, the read samples were appended to channels. also in `import.cpp` and `projectfilemanager.cpp`(i forgot the exact name but it was something similar), it looked like only those `tracks` were used. basically, i am confused that if only channels created with `wavetrackfactory` and `samplerate` are enough or i need to somehow append the decoded samples to the channels.~ (edit : sorry i misunderstood it, now seems to be clear) hopefully i will be able complete in 1 or 2 days. thanks..."
1099136838,2224,crsib,2022-04-14T12:32:09Z,"hi sorry for the delay! can you please rebase onto the latest master, squash you changes into a single commit and force push?"
1099148552,2224,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-14T12:45:41Z,"i would like to see a rebase too, but not necessarily a squash to one commit, if the intermediate steps are really useful for review of the new feature in sensible incremental steps, and not just corrections of mistakes."
1099384618,2224,Subhra264,2022-04-14T16:35:57Z,"no issues! :) yeah, actually, i added new commits after the previous commit is bug-free ( i mean, after resolving the bugs i encountered related to that particular feature/implementation, so may not be ""bug-free"" ). so, each commit mostly represents a new feature/file. for example, the first commit is about integrating wavpack and creating a file containing all the necessary class details, the second commit implements all the `importplugin` and `importfilehandle` class methods, and the third commit is to read tags, etc."
1157452320,2224,crsib,2022-06-16T09:41:18Z,"hi ! sorry for this long delay. i have crafted a commit, that should resolve your ci issues [a link] can you please cherry pick it in your branch and rebase everything onto the latest master?"
1157955712,2224,Subhra264,2022-06-16T17:39:33Z,all checks passed! thank you!
1160445181,2224,Subhra264,2022-06-20T13:23:30Z,"i have replaced `fileio` with `wxfile` as seeking to the first block of the file was required. i have tested the wavpack files generated from audacity with vlc media player. now, it seems to work correctly as it is now allowing seeking and the audio length is also shown. also, i have addressed the changes you asked me to make. the latest commit is now ready for another review."
1161636658,2224,Subhra264,2022-06-21T11:44:59Z,"ok then, i will commit and push the remaining exportwavpack changes along with importwavpack changes."

1568304039,4746,saintmatthieu,2023-05-30T11:55:49Z,"some questions : * `mixersource` already used to be a collection of tracks, one per channel, * iteration over the channels used to be done in `::acquire`, now it is one stack level below, in `mixsamerate` or `mixvariablerates`, * in the future, `sampleframesequence` will provide multi-channel audio data, and the channel iteration in `mixersource` can be removed."
1582392493,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-08T11:14:09Z,"names changed since you wrote this, otherwise its a correct summary."
1585873620,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-11T00:30:21Z,"in anticipation of the merge of #4742 soon, i have rebased this branch onto that one, and made only the changes needed for conflict resolution. the commit ""segregate widesamplesequence from the sampletrack interface..."" is still the first one proper to this new branch, and only that one and later ones should be reviewed."
1586260170,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-11T17:44:56Z,"force pushed again, with some new and fixup commits inserted to address your comments."
1587378053,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-12T13:46:55Z,the latest force-push only squashes the fixup commits and edits some commit comments.
1588685537,4746,saintmatthieu,2023-06-13T07:15:07Z,"pushed back to ""in progress"" because export is broken : ![a link] the mono track was exported to stereo, and a 4-second chunk is clipped to -1."
1590073259,4746,saintmatthieu,2023-06-13T21:54:29Z,"here is the problem i see during mix-and-render: ![a link] the lower track is the rendering of the upper track. i was debugging this because i have a branch based on this one (for the stretching decorator) and thought i was doing a mistake, but by reverting i could verify that the problem came from elsewhere. i suspect the `sampletrackcache` to be passing incorrect pointers to the wavetrack. i also verified that it is not on current master (0ec7ab2908f2acb5759323e1f5b5f345698e3d1b)"
1590871576,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-14T09:52:55Z,[a link] was it this commit that you built? describe exact steps to reproduce. probably the bug is in sampletrackcacke. i confirmed that i could reproduce the bug in export and that it was fixed.
1591155393,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-14T12:56:52Z,"rebased once more after #4792 was merged, so now only 23 commits"

1594482974,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-16T10:45:05Z,i observe that mixing and rendering crashes even with no effect stack. was that bug introduced by this branch or by an earlier merged pr?
1594489308,4746,dozzzzer,2023-06-16T10:51:13Z,"if you refer to the wide wave clip pr #4742 – no, it shows no issues with mixing-and-rendering both with and without effect stack. so it seems that the problem was introduced by this branch."
1594490642,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-16T10:52:30Z,"i observe not only a crash, but the recovery file is also somehow corrupted to cause a crash if you restart and try to recover."
1594498819,4746,dozzzzer,2023-06-16T10:59:58Z,"i don't see the crash when trying to recover, but weirdly enough in addition to the stereo track i also have a mono track in the recovered project which isn't supposed to be there."
1594804951,4746,Paul-Licameli,2023-06-16T14:38:57Z,"rebased onto recent master, with a new fixup that removes a mistaken assertion from an earlier pr, which was violated when you mix stereo to mono. i am still investigating the bug in rendering."
1601138896,4746,dozzzzer,2023-06-21T16:14:40Z,"tested on macos 13.0, windows 11 vm and ubuntu 22.04 vm. what was tested: - all bullet points on the list of things to be checked - cases with mismatched left and right channel lengths, such as mixing-and-rendering, export, playback - made sure that all previously found bugs introduced by this pr were fixed"

1634431330,4668,DavidBailes,2023-07-13T15:16:21Z,two of the access keys are difficult to see: 1. folder: using d would be better than l. 2. custom mapping: using a would be better than g. in addition i'm still very concerned about the keyboard navigation of the radio buttons for the export range - see: [a link] see also: [a link]
1634618281,4668,petersampsonaudacity,2023-07-13T17:18:02Z,testing on w10 with vitaly's latest branch build: audacity-win-3.4.0-alpha-20230713+e7f58dd-x64 #4819 is properly fixed: a) the new dialog appears b) there is no crash when accessing the export dialog(s) for the automated export c) the timer record works and exports properly
1635737221,4668,DavidBailes,2023-07-14T11:39:01Z,see also [a link] - is happy with changing the order of the export range radio buttons to get round this bug.
1636742744,4668,DavidBailes,2023-07-15T11:36:05Z,". thanks for changing the order. noticed that the accessibility name of the multiple files radio button is still ""export split in parts"", and so needs changing to ""export multiple files""."
1636802897,4668,petersampsonaudacity,2023-07-15T15:36:34Z,actually in 's latest branch build: audacity-win-3.4.0-alpha-20230713+e7f58dd-x64 it is already **multiple files** ![a link]
1637583026,4668,DavidBailes,2023-07-17T08:20:04Z,"by ""accessibility name"" of the radio button i was referring to the name of the radio button read by screen readers. sometimes it's helpful if this name is different from the visible name. in this case the text ""export range"" is not automatically read by screen readers, so it's helpful to add the word export to the accessibility name. just use narrator to see what's going on in this case (windows + ctrl + enter to start or stop)."
1637669282,4668,vsverchinsky,2023-07-17T09:19:36Z,thanks! fixed
1641990489,4668,DavidBailes,2023-07-19T12:25:40Z,". only just noticed that there are a couple of other accessibility names that need setting. when the format is set to custom ffmpeg export, there are two text controls: current format and current codec. these currently have empty accessible names. windowaccessible is automatically set as the accessible object for text controls in shuttlegui, so all that is needed is to set the accessible name for these text controls (like you did for sliders)."

1645474690,4668,petersampsonaudacity,2023-07-21T12:04:24Z,in an earlier version of vita;'s new export we has a field for **channel mode** which has now disappeared in the later versions: ![a link]

1731601545,5042,saintmatthieu,2023-09-22T15:20:06Z,"i agree that the rendering doesn't look great. there are two upcoming fixes that could improve this: a more accurate delay estimation #5206, and solving the indeterministic behaviour you found #5210. but i'm confident that this limitation isn't related to drawing. drawing modifies the samples as expected. only the rendering of the result isn't necessarily as expected :d"
852656377,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-02T02:08:57Z,we're still interested in this proposal. please see more discussion at the audacity forum.
853029046,830,dofuuz,2021-06-02T13:29:50Z,"-licameli rebased commit at recent upstream master branch. tbh, i'm not fully satisfied with cla. but i belive that commercial profit and support can boost imporvement on oss. so i signed at the cla anyway. i just wish audacity would remain free, open and be **much greater** than now. :grinning_face:"
853302878,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-02T18:51:42Z,"as for that, i share those hopes. i not only hope so, i expect so, from what i know. though that is on the understanding that code of the audacity audio editor ""remaining free"" is consistent with the possibility of a dual sub-licensing of parts of it that the cla leaves open."

856609924,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-08T09:23:18Z,i have not forgotten this! i will write more today.
859609792,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-11T14:10:36Z,i just tested on w10 with dofuuz's latest build and i see that we now have the changed color descriptions in spectrogram preferences as we discussed. thanks for sorting that. ![a link]
859610327,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-11T14:11:26Z,i tested with pure spectrogram and with multi-view dor the new and alternative colorways
859611926,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-11T14:13:43Z,"thanks, peter. did you also observe the changes in set track visuals? a choice replaces what was only a checkbox for grayscale."
859617200,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-11T14:22:02Z,"paul, i assume you mean from the tcp - in which case yes, i have been playing with that too and all looks fine."
859620339,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-11T14:26:40Z,"no, i refer to one of the macro commands. see #969"
861164424,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T04:42:30Z,"i'm pleased with these changes to address my points. each commit builds. i am satisfied too now with changes in acolor.cpp. (i might suggest that the names in acolorresources.h could be made static, to have no linkage and spare a little space in symbol tables.) but i do not want the change in experimental.h. it leaves no visual indication of sync lock in a spectrogram. if you think this change is very important, than i think some alternative solution should be sought. the sync lock tiles might be painted more than once (as they are in waveform view). they might be repainted last, with transparency. perhaps you fill follow up this implementation suggestion. so to summarize: please rebase onto most master, and omit the change to experimental.cmake. then i will approve it and merge it!"
861173140,830,dofuuz,2021-06-15T05:07:18Z,"removing transparency from spectrogram is important fix! without the change, new colormap gonna lose its power. i'll find if there are easy and nice fix for this situation..."
861203172,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-15T06:11:01Z,"but even in current audacity there is very poor visual indication of sync-lock in a spectrogram ... the example image below was made with 3.0.2 ![a link] this image flatters the real-life situation a) it is (at least) double real-life size - much harder to see in audacity on-screen b) i deliberately greatly reduced the amplitude of the left half of the selction, note that in the right half of the selection in the spectrogarm track the clocks are barely visible at all. i thought we had a bugzilla entry for this, but i can't find it. maybe we should be logging one ..."
861274917,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-15T07:56:20Z,i logged this as p3 bug #2806 [a link] spectrogram view has poor/inadequate visual cues to show sync-lock selection and remember that this is not a result of the new spectrogram colorway - it's always been like this.
861446617,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T12:13:04Z,"as your branch is now, there is no indication at all of sync lock, rather than the existing one, poor though that might be. why do you think removing transparency of the spectrogram is very important? in my own trials building your branch, i did not think it looked bad either with or without it. would you consider merging the branch with transparency, but opening an issue to correct the problems? i see your example in ""obstacles."" [a link]"
861456344,830,SteveDaulton,2021-06-15T12:28:49Z,"i don't think that losing the sync-lock ""clocks"" in spectrogram view is a problem. even with ""classic"" spectrogram view they are barely visible with real world audio, and imo they are little more than visual clutter when they are. waveform view, or multi-view are far better suited to temporal editing. i'd rather have a clearer view of the spectrogram in track spectrogram view than overlaid information that is irrelevant to ""spectral"" editing."
861466558,830,dofuuz,2021-06-15T12:44:22Z,![a link] ↑ new color with `spectrogram_overlay` transparency. clock background on 4th track is almost not visible. transparency makes the visual totally different from what i intended(accurate and pretty). background becomes brighter than some of foreground. there are some grain around black which should not appear. it means loss of accuracy. overall color becomes desaturated. not pretty. bringing clock overlay on top of spectrogram [a link] might be the fix. but basically i have same opinion with .
861466852,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T12:44:50Z,"if we want to keep the clocks but also make spectrogram non-transparent, then i think a solution is to draw the clocks with transparency, not the track, and paint the clocks later. if we lose all of the clocks in spectral view, arguably that's a regression. but maybe steve and peter would agree not to treat it as such. are there examples of clocks on the spectrogram in the manual? if so they would be one more thing to change in manual images. i think the objection that clocks are clutter for spectral editing is irrelevant. the track that you do interact with, for spectral editing, never shows the clocks. the clocks indicate what part of another track will be affected, if the track you do interact with changes its length with insertion or deletion. spectral editing doesn't do that, but other edits do."
861468919,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T12:48:07Z,"how did you do that ""like this"" picture? did you change audacity source code to do it?"
861469589,830,dofuuz,2021-06-15T12:49:07Z,no. i used image editor.
861494911,830,petersampsonaudacity,2021-06-15T13:24:21Z,"it's not really our call any more - but i would certainly be happy with the way it si now with the closcks invisible on the spectrogram (i agree with steve's views above that a) they've been largely unvisible on soectrograms anyway and b) other views are better for temporal editing) so if muse qa and rm agree (dmitry, martin, jouni) i would vote for this - and this would then let me close p3 bug 2806. as far as i can recall no user has ever complained about the clocks on spectrograms - porr visibiliy of or lack thereof."
861549576,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T14:30:32Z,"i would leave bug 2806 open. but we need to get a release out very soon, and these new colors will be a banner feature, and i don't want this detail to block it. maybe myungchul will even write the fix easily. i outlined how we might to do it. repaint the clocks, after the spectrum, making the clocks the transparency."
861609491,830,dofuuz,2021-06-15T15:41:45Z,"![a link] ↑ in development screenshot, left: light theme, right: dark theme fortunately, it seems like the fix is not hard to implement. i'll push commit after some cleanup in couple of days. for now, i have to sleep:sleeping_face: to adjust color and transparency of clock overlay, we need to edit theme image. i won't do this. i think the clock should be gray, 50% transparent."
861618111,830,SteveDaulton,2021-06-15T15:52:39Z,"thanks for trying the clocks dofuuz, but from a user perspective i would much prefer to not have the clocks. when using track spectrogram view and sync-lock, i would have to temporarily turn off sync-lock to remove the distraction of the clocks. that's more work for the user, and a needless distraction from their workflow. the user can already see if sync-lock is on by looking for the clock in the control panel on the left hand end of the track - which is how users have had to work (with zero complaints) when using the ""classic"" spectrogram color scheme. with qa hat on, usability trumps consistency. now that i can see what it looks like with the new color scheme + clocks (thank you), i would say that it is significantly worse than not having the clocks showing in spectrograms. steve"
861648200,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T16:28:08Z,"thank you, steve. you have a strong opinion about the clocks. i do not have a strong opinion about them -- which is why i brought the matter up: in the absence of strong opinions, the presumption should be conservatism about the application's behavior, changing only what one needs to change for the really new feature. in this case, hiding the clocks was not the intention of the feature, but a side-effect of trying to achieve something else, the non-transparency that improved spectrogram appearance. however, given your remarks now, i find no reason left to delay the merger of this pull request. if someone really wants to overrule the elimination of the clocks, let them raise an issue."
861659708,830,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-15T16:44:29Z,merged! the residual issue about the clocks -- if anyone insists on keeping them -- is already at: [a link]
861912635,830,dofuuz,2021-06-16T00:06:49Z,"great:grinning_squinting_face: we can implement sync-lock overlay later, if there are anyone complain about it."

857973805,966,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-09T18:46:11Z,i will await resolution of points i raised before continuing review.
862870490,966,Paul-Licameli,2021-06-17T02:37:00Z,"before anything else: again, please simplify the commit history. make one simple, straight branch. do not include merge commits. rebase or cherry-pick one of the branches onto the other. you could do [code block] and then, rebase onto more recent master and force-push. you might also do git rebase -i and make some of these commits fixups so the history is shorter."
1127854928,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-16T16:03:12Z,"tested on macos 12.3.1 monterey with branch build: audacity-macos-3.2.0-alpha-20220516+4592471-x86_64 i can't test on windows as those are not building artifacts. i see the new cogwheel ""audacity audio setup toolbar"" - can't test the options on mac as there are no options to switch to. ![a link] afaict (limited on mac) the **cogwheel>audio settings** dialog and the **cogwheel>input settings** both seem to interact correctly with the devices preferences. **this begs a question:** do we really need devices preferences now that we have the cogwheel since there seems to be total overlap between the new ""**audio settings - devices**"" dialog and the **devices prefs** dialog? flagging and as a ux/design issue. i note that the device toolbar has been removed entirely (_replaced by the new toolbar in the view>toolbars menu_). i assume that this is intentional? -------------------------------------- **my initial feedback** is that i think the cogwheel is a good replacement for the device toolbar especially as it appears to be ""enabled"" by default. i like the fact that it is a lot more economical in terms of screen real-estate occupied.of note is that in the early versions of audacity dominic mazzoni did not have a device toolbar, just devices prefs."
1127883848,2941,LWinterberg,2022-05-16T16:28:45Z,"no, this was a miscommunication. the device toolbar is supposed to be just hidden, not completely removed."
1127889972,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-16T16:34:58Z,so that would give the user **_three_** ways to make the same settings - that seems a little ott. i can see that you might want to keep it hidden by default just so that users used to having a device toolbar can still have one - but it is somewhat redundant. the only advantage that it has is that (when enabled) it always shows the user what the basic devices settings are.
1127908172,2941,Tantacrul,2022-05-16T16:54:17Z,"perhaps we're being overly cautious. i'm worried about all those tutorials that show people how to record from their laptop, etc. i'll need to **really call this out** in our release video."
1127921430,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-16T17:08:18Z,"but since you'll be hiding the device toolbar by default a lot of those users will still be fretting ... so yes a ""good call out"" in the release video will be a good idea."
1127979237,2941,SteveDaulton,2022-05-16T18:08:46Z,"i see that this is still listed as ""work in progress"", but in case it's helpful, it's not working correctly for me. if the ""output device"" and/or ""input device"" are set to non-default settings in the main ""cog wheel"" menu, then setting the devices in either of ""cog > audio settings"" or ""preferences > devices"" have no effect. testing with the ubuntu 20.04 appimage on xubuntu 20.04."
1128849250,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-17T13:09:30Z,testing on w10 with latest branch build i) the interaction between the cogwheel audio setup and the devices preferences is not working for the input and output devices 2) that interaction seems to work ok for the host - and for buffer length and latency compensation 3) a nomenclature **_inconsistency_** has been introduced the first entry on the cogwheel menu is called **driver type** - this has always been **host** in the app and documentation ![a link] in preferences it is **host** ![a link] and even in cogwheel>audio settings... it is **host** too ![a link] so the inconsistency exists even within the new cogwheel setup 4) note too that there is a nomenclature difference/inconsistency between a) preferences & audio settings dialogs which use **playback device** and **recording device** b) whereas the cogwheel menu uses **output device** and **input device** for the same things
1128901495,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-17T13:53:56Z,5) making a device setting in the cogwheel does not stick - it reverts to default: 1. purge audacity settings folder (for ootb default factory settings) 2. launch latest cogwheel branch audacity-win-3.2.0-alpha-20220516+465d3ee-x64-msvc2022 3. observe in both cogwheel and pref s the default playback an recording devices match and are the default 4. in cogwheel change the recording device to be the non-default **stereo mix** ymmv 5. exit the cogwheel 6. click again the cogwheel 7. note that the stereo mix has not stuck and the input device has reverted to the default the same happens if i set either the input device or output device to be the non-deafults: microsoft sound mapper... and i note that the same is now true if i use prefs rather than the cogwheel (this is a **_regression_** on 3.1.3 and earlier) _it basically looks like cogwheel-audacity is basically ignoring any settings the user makes in prefs or cogwheel for the input and output devices and always reverts to the defaults._
1128952578,2941,Tantacrul,2022-05-17T14:36:34Z,- can you make all the changes to strings that has raised (basically returning to what audacity already uses)?
1128956996,2941,Tantacrul,2022-05-17T14:40:20Z,"- nice spot about those settings being ignored. - i think we'll need to fix this too and make sure that whatever place you do it, the setting is reflected everywhere else. i've recorded a little video to demonstrate. basically, the preferences are just being ignored. [a link] it almost seems like the 'device' toolbar is the 'king' here and the options in preferences are subordinate."
1128975333,2941,SteveDaulton,2022-05-17T14:55:48Z,"yes. [a link] if you compare with deaa3f you will see that in the older 3.2.0 alpha version, changing the recording / playback devices in preferences updates the device toolbar settings, and vice versa."
1128989429,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-17T15:08:08Z,"if the device toolbar is to be retained (as you said earlier) then perhaps you can add a menu item to the cogwheel menu for showing/hiding device toolbar ? that would be less cumbersome than going to view>toolbars - and should be more ""discoverable""."
1129028286,2941,petersampsonaudacity,2022-05-17T15:42:46Z,testing on w10 with the latest branch build: audacity-win-3.2.0-alpha-20220517+5d5623f-x64-msvc2022 1) i find that if i make a change to a non-default device using cogwheel>audio settings dialog then the change does not stick and stays at default device. 2) but if i use cogwheel > input device then to make then change than it douse stick - and it shows as changed in prefs 3) i still find that changes i make in devices for the i/o devices still do not stick and revert/stay defaults 4) the strings have not been changed as requested
1129047693,2941,Tantacrul,2022-05-17T15:59:56Z,i would say we should get it functioning properly first and then test it a bit before doing that. i have no idea how much of an impact this change may make.

2104747376,6359,Paul-Licameli,2024-05-10T14:50:09Z,"i have completed a review of changes in audioio.cpp. if my contribution of per track meters is also wanted, there is a lot of needed work to make these compatible. i may volunteer my own very different rewrite of audioio.cpp to support a master channel in the right way. i understand that: - the sequence of transformations on individual tracks includes time warping (for time track), muting (of individual tracks), effects (stacked on single tracks), panning, in that order. - then you mix tracks and apply the master stack, on the producer side of the ringbuffer. (as for individual stacks. we must avoid who knows what computations in opaque code, on the low-latency consumer side.) - micro-fading is still applied on the consumer side. - there are only one or two ringbuffers corresponding to the device output channels. the old version, without a master stack, differed in these ways: - there was a ringbuffer for each wavechannel. - applying mute and pan, and mixing of the ringbuffer outputs, was done on the consumer side. questions might arise about subtle differences of results, moving the muting before the effect processing. (is it better with your change? have you tried muting a track with a reverb, during play -- which before, would just mute it at once, but after, might instead produce the decaying tail of what was unmuted?) also, whether pan should apply before a per-track effect or after: it might make a difference for certain effects like reverbs that are not simple ltis but might work in terms of mid and side channels. (, opinion?) more later..."
2107765303,6359,Paul-Licameli,2024-05-13T14:31:55Z,"more: the existing ring buffers should not be removed. ring buffers for the master mix should be added. the consumer thread should take equal samples out of all of them. only the samples from the master mix are stored in the output buffer of the audio io callback. this allows future development to send the buffers of pre-mixed per-track data inter-thread, back to the master thread for drawing. see `sendvuinputmeterdata` and `sendvuoutputmeterdata` which now do such inter-thread communication: but i would need to send other buffers too. my thinking is this: the consumer thread needs to have access to intermediate states of calculation of the mix samples, corresponding in time to the ultimate output. those intermediates should be sent to other code that performs graphical display, keeping as closely synchronized as possible with the real-time playback. that synchronization will not be perfect, given the reality of frame refresh rates. still, the latency of the ringbuffer itself should be accounted for in that drawing update. sending the per-track information to the main thread more directly from the producer thread would make less perfect synchronization of the display. therefore, more data should be travelling through ring buffers from the high-throughput but variable-latency producer thread, to the more regularly updating consumer thread."
2111587483,6359,saintmatthieu,2024-05-15T04:59:15Z,-licameli good point about reverb. i confirm that muting a track may not instantly mute the sound but any effect with a tail will continue ringing. it may sound better but i don't think this is the wanted behaviour: muting is muting. what if the effect is a long echo ? ?
2111592889,6359,saintmatthieu,2024-05-15T05:04:16Z,"about panning before or after, yes, if the effect is non lti, this would make a difference. if there is one place for panning and gain, i think it should be where it is a the moment, after the effect stack. i guess other daws do it that way, too (or may have also a ""pre-gain""), and if a non lti effect such as a compressor comes in, it will come with its own pre-processing gain parameter. a mid/side encoding/decoding operation is a linear operation, though, so in that particular case it should not make a difference."

1870094918,5818,vsverchinsky,2023-12-27T09:02:32Z,i've attempted to fix that but not sure that it was correct: ![a link] ![a link]
1870103599,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-27T09:12:53Z,"linux build is failing. is this only about waveform painting? if so, rename it all as lin-waveform-paint. or maybe lib-waveform-geometry if the library will also handle any hit testing. the painting and hit testing for anything painted on the screen should be kept together. painting maps some thing to pixel x and y coordinates, while hit testing must know the inverse of the same mapping."
1870107894,5818,crsib,2023-12-27T09:17:51Z,"i strongly disagree. these topics are irrelevant most of the time, and definitely irrelevant here."
1870112880,5818,crsib,2023-12-27T09:23:59Z,"`lib-wave-track-paint` is a green library providing a way to build visuals for wave tracks. right now, only waveform painting has been migrated to this library. neither vitaly nor i ever migrated the ""green"" part of the spectrogram painting. this can be done, however."
1870129237,5818,vsverchinsky,2023-12-27T09:43:59Z,"trying to fix that... right now it has only waveform image generation part. as you mentioned it could provide geomentry data that will be useful for hit testing and in that case `lib-waveform-geometry` could be an option too. it could indeed provide geometry information for hit testing purpose, as hit testing itself usually refers to platform or framework specific code, i think. but there is nothing to hit test right now. this library does not provide any means to draw ""lollipops"" or envelopes that can be manipulated."
1870135083,5818,crsib,2023-12-27T09:51:19Z,"i strongly disagree. this is a lower-level library, that is only responsible for helping the waveformview to **paint** given the zoominfo, selection, and screen bounds. it is not responsible for interactions and it should be kept that way."
1870208788,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-27T11:20:42Z,"no, don't make it responsible completely for interactions. however the association between pixel coordinates and things in the data model ought to be defined in one place. a mapping of things to pixels required for painting, and its inverse mapping, should be defined together and kept consistent. so maybe what i want to argue is that lib-waveform-geometry would be separated from a painting library and do only such coordinate transformations. lib-waveform-painting could depend on it, and hit testing would also depend on it, but neither of those two would depend on the other. my opinion about spectrogram is that it is a completely different association of things with pixels, at least in the y coordinate, and would have its own separate libraries."
1870213113,5818,crsib,2023-12-27T11:26:41Z,"zoominfo is still used to achieve this purpose. this library provides the way to cache imagery, required to draw wavetrack. spectrograms are no different in this aspect. the way how the specific bitmap is generated can be lifted away from the library, resulting in 3 libraries: caching, waveform bitmap generation, and spectrogram image generation."
1870226702,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-27T11:38:28Z,"yes, the association x-coordinate with time is common to spectrum and waveform views, and is already in lib-screen-geometry which does not even depend on wxbase. the two kinds of views define very different meanings for y-coordinates however and would have completely different paint procedures, in the detailed use of that caching and blitting layer. really i must go beyond my simple reaction to the pull request title and really review it to see what's really there. i'm still waking up."
1871121357,5818,crsib,2023-12-28T12:28:41Z,"i would like the review to pause, for now, -licameli 1. it was not agreed yet that we need it for 3.5 or for audacity 3 at all. 2. most of the comments are related to disliking names. this brings an enormous cognitive load when reading the comments. 3. likely the part you are looking at now can be omitted. 4. the next commit is enourmous. unless we agree first on some basic ideas i expect the review to span hundreds of comments again. i would like to avoid that. 5. i don't remember the details of the code, so i can't respond to the comments. if martin and yana would approve moving this pr forward, we will clean it up with vitaly first and discuss the ideas on the dev call first."
1871130220,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-28T12:40:52Z,"all right, i will stop. but please note: there is more than just naming to object to. i think there are real off-by-one errors in the bounding box class."
1871147681,5818,crsib,2023-12-28T12:58:18Z,"i agree, there are errors for sure."
1871447058,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-28T19:46:30Z,"i'm not reviewing, just noting other thoughts while compiling something else. there is a need to distinguish point and vector. surely rectangle stores a point for top left, and boundingbox for top left and bottom right. i didn't review size completely, but it too has some strangeness (like multiplication of two sizes, why?). maybe size should become the vector class and a rectangle can be defined by a point and a diagonal vector. but should rectangles be ""oriented"" (with possibly negative area) or just have non-negative area always? -- then maybe rectangle should instead always canonicalize itself to have a diagonal with non-negative components, and the corner as the real top-left."
1871508549,5818,crsib,2023-12-28T21:44:59Z,"there is a common terminology in ui toolkits, where point has some vector-like properties. you can observe similar properties with qpoint and wxpoint. there is absolutely no need to distinguish points and vectors unless the ultimate goal is to teach students about doing dimensions in c++. i don't recall the concept of ""point"" in math though. they are pretty much the synonyms, used interchangeably. usually rendering engines call such structures ""vectors"" and ui toolkit ""points"". i think that ""point"" is used in ui for the last 40 years or so. we can rename it to vector, just to save time on this code review, but i'd rather not. i am hard against having both points and vectors. it will create lots of mess in the code for very little and strictly academic (?) reason. we are writing software, not a research paper. it must be fast, readable, and maintainble. both vector and points may have component by component division, even if it makes little sense from the mathematical perspective. they are not multiplicative inverses, but from the programming point of view they can be useful. for example , when you need to represent a different scale on different axises. in fact, this operation is implemented in hardware both for cpus and gpus. defining a rectangle is quite complex topic indeed. that is why there are two different definitions in this library alone. however, the way how rectangle is defined is never about defining the most correct one from the math point of view. it's about convince and performance. i don't think that we need aabb for the sake of this pr. they were used in code that was further 10x faster than this. that's it, 100x faster than audacity is now. however, i think that point (with vector properties, sorry), size, and rect as (point, size) could be useful overall. i agree, that there is a better place for them now than lib-graphics. they surely need better unit test coverage. i would love to have adequate color class too. wxcolour is quite heavy and not too useful. to summarize, i don't like renaming points to vectors, but i don't care much. i will stand hard against adding vectors on top of the points or defining rectangles using diagonals."
1871677505,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-29T02:11:05Z,the standard library distinguishes time points from durations in chrono. it does not affect the performance of compiled code but it makes distinctions between variables that allow programming errors to be caught at compile time and increases confidence in correctness of code that does compile. what i suggest is simply analogous to that.
1871692389,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-29T02:58:20Z,affine space is a different mathematical notion from vector space. one has points with no distinguished origin. the other describes displacements in an affine space. [a link]
1871885925,5818,crsib,2023-12-29T09:46:47Z,"to be able to describe a point in affine space you need to have a basis. when you have a basis vectors and points are pretty much the synonyms. i don't see how std::chrono and points as defined in ui are related. chrono attaches units to the durations and time_points have implementation defined basis, unknown to the user in principle. both concerns are critical to chrono. at the same time chrono is very verbose and rarely used in extensive computations. in graphics, we always have a well defined basis for the screen space. we don't need to attach units to the points (this is not true for typography or for physics, but we are not doing a physics library). the vectors and points are the synonyms in this case. there is absolutely no need to separate between them except making the point (no pun intended). i won't change my opinion. in case the discussion about this topic will take too much time, this pr will be dropped and qpoint (with vector properties!) will be used for the needs of the qt version of the audacity."
1871893801,5818,Paul-Licameli,2023-12-29T09:58:08Z,"you asked my opinion in review and i gave it. i would design these classes differently. points and vectors may have a common representation but they do not have the same algebra. a static type distinction between them can catch errors at compile time and also make the signatures of functions more informative. just as we distinguish different types of identifier rather than pass naked strings around, or use enumerations — similarly there are number pairs used for different purposes and i would distinguish them. a point is a position in a geometric space. a vector is not, but is a displacement from point to point. scaling a vector is meaningful. scaling a point is not."
1871929568,5818,crsib,2023-12-29T10:27:17Z,"and i have strong reasons to disagree with you. i'm unsure how to read this, but i will stress again: we are not doing academic papers, and we are not implementing an abstract concept. we don't. there are 2 cases in the code where taggedidentifier is used, and urlstring is a clearly a bad example of one. it is not used in the code anymore; i have forgotten to remove it. otherwise, we just use identifier. it gives no better type-safety over the raw strings. we have exactly one type-safe identifier: normalizedkeystring. is it an identifier at all? i don't know, but that feels a bit wrong. we rarely use them, preferring identifiers, which are essentially strings and are not type-safe. gosh, we have places where `any` is used. we are constantly dependent on a global state. we have so many places that need attention right now, so why waste time and mental resources on discussing points vs vectors, irrelevant to the use case they are designed for? this statement is wrong when we are talking about gui of any kind. at least, since the first release of android :-) --- i honestly feel that we are in the ""snapping"" pr space again. however, that pr was critical because it was fixing the functionality required for release, which was implemented wrong. this one is not. i have no time, or energy, or will to discuss this topic."

1183283099,3183,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-13T14:16:21Z,"not wrong, but not necessary, just to hide mention of the member maeffect inside the function vsteffect::loadparameters. right, and necessary, to use maeffect somewhere if a ""chunk"" must be reinterpreted as a settings object. it's then a scratch handle. but, i think that if loadparameters takes the other path that does not use the chunks, then it is not necessary to use a scratch handle, not necessary to define `storecommandparameters` or then to use `fetchsettings`. on that path, a direct conversion can be done from strings stored in the config file into values in the map in effectsettings."
1183309842,3183,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-13T14:39:02Z,"it should be a translator, but sometimes needs a scratch handle, as with the paht that uses chunks. but not the rest. you wrote `storecommandparameters` which uses a handle but unnecessarily. don't add the function, but just adapt loadsettings to interpret `parms` and update a map. there is no need to retain `storecommandparameters`. change `loadsettings` to avoid use of a handle and iterate over the config file. well you did that already. but also, do not change the convention previously used to name the keys associated with the values. maybe what you misunderstand is that `loadparameters`, which is used by `loaduserpreset`, is also intended as a translator only. side effect on a scratch handle for the interpretation of chunks is unavoidable as part of interpretation. but on other paths, it is not important to keep whatever side effects used to happen."

(for backwards compatibility) also, i completely removed the `filelayout_xdg` logic since it would only affect `config` and we would still need to implement the xdg logic manually for `cache`, `data` and `state`, at which point there is no reason to use `getuserconfigdir` only for `config`. for now, `cache` and `state` aren't used anywhere. if you have any suggestions regarding which other old `datadir()` calls should be replaced with `cache`, `config` or `state`, feel free to point them out. i am not too familiar with the various audacity `xml` files, so i don't know, which of them should go to `config` or `data` or `state` etc."

1927201760,5874,saintmatthieu,2024-02-05T15:01:39Z,"i don't know how much of the problems you've found this covered, but at least some of it: there already is a bug on master. 1. import 100_vintagedrums_03_tl.wavv, it gets correctly auto-detected. 2. import jbk_170_brk_full_drums_stig_v1.wav, this one too. 3. import again 100_vintagedrums_03_tl.wav: it gets detected as 170. if the 2nd file hadn't metadata, there wouldn't be a problem. it's my fault, i have to fix this, but it should provide a separate fix. would you mind re-testing these two problems with files that have no metadata, just their bpm in the title? to be 100% sure that they don't have metadata, you may re-export your loops from audacity."

1102656440,2831,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-19T13:28:26Z,"steve agrees with me about not breaking macros, so changing localized names independently from internal names. i reviewed how nyquist parses names, and it does not make this similarly easy to do -- to update a localized name while not changing the identifier that macros might be using. i intend to change nyquist.cpp and i can push that commit onto vitaly's branch. then the .ny files can update certain localized nyquist effect names as leo prefers them, but without the compatibility problem. meanwhile, exploring the source for steve harris' ladspa plug-ins, i found this bit about the terminology of its simple inversion effect: [code block]"
1102666167,2831,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-19T13:36:18Z,"vitaly and i are disagreeing about the proposed implementation. in this first attempt, the tree that leo specified is essentially replicated in one place in the source code. i don't find that acceptable. instead, i say category information should be associated with each individual effect in the code that defines that effect. the code that builds the effect menu should iterate all effects and gather their category information in a generalized way according to some new extension of the effect interface, then sort them without special hardcoded information about any one effect. i have pointed out that certainly in the case of nyquist effects, some other nyquist programmer wanting to extend audacity should have means to specify in the .ny file how to categorize that effect, without rebuilding audacity. i say build into audacity now the code that interprets a new kind of special nyquist comment, then use that comment in .ny files."
1102717441,2831,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-19T14:21:20Z,"i think extra effort is needed for open-endedness. if you really do want to go beyond my incomplete suggestion, i would encourage it. the value returned by the new virtual function of effect would not be of an enumeration type. it would be a componentinterfacesymbol pairing an identifier and a translatablestring. effect.h could have extern declaration of some componentinterfacesymbol constants commonly used, including the ones specified in the issue. but pluginmenus.cpp would not require the returned values to be from this limited set of choices. what i described would not provide a way to order the categories extrinsically. but if agrees that a rule like major sort by the localization of the category name is acceptable, then that's enough."

1710902686,5139,Paul-Licameli,2023-09-08T00:00:32Z,"so maybe this bug fix allows some data to be plotted instead of nothing, but it’s bogus. what should be done? - ignore this as an unlikely use case? - detect clip stretch mismatch and display an error rather than bogus data? - do the hard work of more proper weighting of values? if the last, maybe the way to do it is make a spectrum analyst for each clip separately, then write something that makes the correct weighted sums of several analyst results as one analyst object to be used later in plotting."
1710919949,5139,Paul-Licameli,2023-09-08T00:28:13Z,"yet another possibility: downgrade the priority of this bug, if in fact, present master doesn’t freeze but only fails to plot anything. then kick the can down to a later release. or just detect failure of `getfloats` and give the user an error dialog explaining the problem, instead of the quiet failure to show any data, or showing bogus data."

1563531345,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-25T21:33:23Z,"i've been thinking more about this. i'm not convinced this will work. in the old caching, the caches were external to the track, and spectrogram drawing or mixersource controlled their lifetimes. the invalidation problem did not exist, because in those contexts it could be assumed that the contents of the track would not be changing in the lifetime of the caches. furthermore, it was possible for different code to access the same wavetrack in different places, but different caches would exist to take advantage of the different patterns of locality. for instance, a track might be playing or looping, while a changing display (such as, spectrogram with pinned play head, or a change of zoom during play) might require a different loop over the blocks concurrently. and yes, concurrently -- there really were multiple threads involved. but putting an internal cursor into the sequence object has all the disadvantage of non-thread-safety; even if synchronized, different fetches from different threads would repeatedly miss the cache; and without a way to destroy the caches early, extra problem of invalidation exists. so we need a very different solution that still allows the caches to be external to the sequence, and yet, lets mixersource control cache lifetimes although it is in lib-sample-track and can't depend on lib-wave-track where sequence lives. but how? i can explain."
1563545023,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-25T21:48:59Z,"1. sequence exposes a function that returns a cache object, and the caller determines its lifetime. 2. (if ever longer lifetimes are needed, such that invalidation becomes a problem, then sequence can be a publisher and the caches can subscribe. but don't do that until it's really necessary, and then be sure there aren't multithreading problems.) 3. `sequence::get` (the overload not taking a first int argument) takes an optional pointer to cache defaulting to nullptr, and uses it if it isn't null. 4. this extra argument propagates up the stack in changes of arguments of waveclip::getsamples(). 5. wavetrack can construct multiple sequence caches (one for each of its clips, storing them in a hash map from clip addresses) and call that single object a cache, and return it to the caller. wavetrack::get(), if given a pointer to a cache from outside, can pass the correct sub-cache to the correct clip as needed. 6. sampletrack can have a new pure virtual function, `makecache`, returning `x` , and its virtual function `get` can take an optional pointer to `x`, defaulting to nullptr. i just explained in 5 how these pure virtuals are overridden. 7. what type is `x`? i think it's a good job for `std::any` -- that's just a polymorphic holder of anything that can be copied and destroyed. `wavetrack::getsamples` packs the box, somebody else (even in lib-sample-track) can hold onto the box, or destroy it, without needing to know what's in it, and then `wavetrack::get` uses `std::any_cast` to look inside the box again. 8. then construct the caches exactly where `sampletrackcache` was constructed before, destroy them exactly where the old caches were destroyed, and wherever the old caches were used, pass the new caches to `sampletrack::get()`."
1563564074,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-25T22:08:51Z,"also some afterthought about `wavetrack::getidealblocksize()`: the side effect it might have had as a non-const function was unimportant, and is possible quite wrong in case the non-const function shadows the const one and becomes more widely used. it could have a side effect of making a new, empty clip. don't do it. just delete that function. and then, what purpose is still served by the old, and const, `getmaxblocksize` ? it is, to hint a a good size for fetching some wavetrack data for a sequential march through a long stretch of track duration, for instance in many of the effects. maybe it's just not important to have this function. those places could just allocate something fixed, like a megabyte. if they later add caches for efficiency or pre-fetching (they aren't cached now, and would not be if you followed my suggestions above strictly), it wouldn't really bring any advantage to tune the effect's buffer size to match the internal buffers of the cache. but there is no harm in keeping the function either, so let it remain and all the existing calls to it."

1563943746,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-26T07:36:48Z,std::any was used without objections here [a link]
1563958332,4723,crsib,2023-05-26T07:49:48Z,"but we are solving different problems here, aren't we? i see this as ""excessive complication for the problem."" especially because it needs propagation `up the stack in changes of arguments of *`. i see it as a much more invasive approach. this is a huge red flag in your proposal. so it cannot be even expressed in type? the user needs to know what is safe to use to manipulate it or where to pass it? it cannot be verified by a compiler? a big, strong no. i had more trouble with `effectsetting` than i asked already. i know that i was not alone. we've been talking through it for a very long time, and i have been largely ignored. so now i will be pushing hard against any such code, which is something i told you before too. js gets type, python gets type, and audacity written in c++ erases types randomly because it's fun and because the committee decides to take `std::any` into the standard. (still not the worst thing that slipped into the std lib, just look at `std::async`) if there are cases where you find per clip/per track caches to be required make an appropriate cache and read using it, do not pass it to the track or clip. this is irrelevant to this problem anyway; we must efficiently satisfy around-the-border reads, which is only the problem with sqlite-based sample blocks. dropping the cache because the caller decided it no longer needs it is a very weird pattern. but again, it still can be done. you can have more than one cache. your cpu has **three** just to satisfy reads. easy. do not use `std::any`. i am really frustrated that i have to cover this again, but while i have never seen a good excuse to use `std::any` (that includes ""what if you need a cache that can store anything by a key""), there are numerous problems it causes: 1. compiler is no longer your friend. it is now the responsibility of the developer to validate types. 2. it violates lsp, and i have a very strong opinion that l is the single most important letter in solid. without l it just makes no sense. 3. it makes debugging intrusive and hard. 4. it breaks all kinds of features that use the knowledge of the code model: code completion, refactoring, static analysis, etc. i was not happy, and i told you that during the review. however, that specific case was nothing more than a scope guard, the returned object was never meant to be used, so i allowed it. it could've been done differently and if i knew that it would be used as an argument for yet another `effectsetting` i would've pushed to do it differently."
1564121330,4723,crsib,2023-05-26T09:48:50Z,"on top of that - `std::any` is not polymorphic. it won't be possible to use different caching policies unless they are implemented within the same cache, so the proposed approach is closed for extension, forcing you to **modify** existing implementation if one needs to extend the behavior."
1564175124,4723,saintmatthieu,2023-05-26T10:26:50Z,"-licameli thanks for your constructive review. i did think of multithreading, and yes, i wouldn't leave this code as-is given this possibility. about the cache lifetime issue, i admit the scenario of a project with many small clips (which would happen if a user concatenates several clip instances of the same underlying data to make a looping track) would require far more memory than necessary. i'm open to alternative approaches and am looking at yours with interest. comments/questions coming up."
1564179127,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-26T10:30:19Z,"two things only are required. the cache can be destroyed when no longer needed. the cache can be passed back to the object that produced it which then interprets it. i foresee no further requirements. no example of a third was given. std::any is sufficient. unique pointer to an ad hoc abstract base class with a virtual destructor could do it too, avoiding std::any but just needing more keystrokes. it addresses the present problems compatibly with library dependencies. i still don’t know what alternative is offered."
1564222335,4723,crsib,2023-05-26T11:04:09Z,"std::any is wrong. why this complexity with passing random objects back and forth? there is a need for a cache with a specific lifetime? create a cache, point it to the data source, and **read from the cache**. that's how caching works. not by passing the cache back to the data source. if it was possible to foresee all the possibilities and requirements - software won't be needed. but this is not the case. ""i do not see now"" does not mean such a case won't occur tomorrow. introducing rigid and overcomplicated code ""just because"" is not something that we need to continue to do. please focus not only on breaking library dependencies. the code should be maintainable and readable first. `std::any` hides dependencies and result in bad code. there is a cache already that suits your needs. it is orthogonal to what was needed for the abandoned graphics pr and to what stretching needs. so leave it this way. do not try to invent a single cache to rule them all, this won't work. in the end, you almost give the answer yourself. if you need a cache that returns you the samples for the given range - **explicitly** define the contract. not with ""comments"", not with `std::any`. explicitly."
1564305241,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-26T12:16:41Z,"i am not the one who first said we should remove the existing cache from spectrogram drawing code. matthieu proposed doing that, and for a good reason. a cache needs to be upstream of the time-stretching processing for performance reasons, and time stretching may need to be calcuated even by drawing code too if we want to remap the display to account for it. i'm not convinced that `std::any` is a tool in the kit that should never to be considered, with proper knowledge of its tradeoffs -- but in this case it was admittedly a reluctant compromise. i thought there was a need to change the sampletrack abstract interface to introduce caches as context arguments. if that can be avoided, while also getting the thread safety, and correctness, and avoidance of excessive allocation -- then that's all to the better, and after more sleep and a chat with matthieu, we are forming some outline of how to do that. so please no more debate about `any`. i'll talk about the next ideas."

1564657214,4723,saintmatthieu,2023-05-26T16:45:39Z,"i realize that, in my draft above, each `waveclip` holds on to one or more `sqlitesampleblock::byteptr`, meaning many clips would mean lots of memory. trying again, this time moving the holders to `sampletrack` implementation level. if the `sampletrack` clients query small audio chunks at a time, which is typical and convenient, then there'd be typically one, sometimes two, strong references to `sqlitesampleblock::byteptr` per track at all time, which would be totally acceptable memory wise. i think that'd address your concern, -licameli, of [code block] it's not perfect that the clients of `sequence` need knowledge of the caching mechanism to use it properly, there may be room for improvement there."
1564659403,4723,saintmatthieu,2023-05-26T16:47:47Z,"mention of the caches in their interface doesn't bother me so much. it would still be an improvement from what we currently have api wise because much easier to use, i expect."

1564854669,4723,crsib,2023-05-26T19:49:21Z,i don't understand why we need a per-block sample cache.
1565156786,4723,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-27T02:08:34Z,"i doubted the idea too at first, but now i see advantages: the cache aligns perfectly to block boundaries, and immutability means no need for invalidation logic. maybe the cache data are held by seqblock and not the sampleblock itself. if the mutable sequence changes, a seqblock can be destroyed and free its cache. maybe sequence can implement an lru policy with a bound on total cache size (or block count) to evict some cache from memory and avoid too much memory usage. doing that mru cache update with thread safety would present some difficulty but i think it could be overcome. these ideas aren’t firmed up yet. we are exploring alternatives and need various ideas."
1567799633,4723,saintmatthieu,2023-05-30T06:02:49Z,"-licameli pointed out that this wasn't thread-safe. looks like we need yet some rather different solution. we are evaluating ideas, but this one looks unlikely to be carried through. declining."

1916769669,5900,Paul-Licameli,2024-01-30T12:45:40Z,i would move `centshiftchange` into `clipsegment.h` and then `waveclip` could publish that type and simply pass a function to `subscribe` without the extra lambda adaptor. it's minor though.

1925325732,5900,petersampsonaudacity,2024-02-03T13:44:34Z,"perhaps most importantly: 6) this pr states that the dynamic pitch change in the clip being played is ""non-destructive"". but testing shows that the pitch change is actually applied destructively (the change goes on the undo/history stack). ![a link] and undo/redo can be applied."
1925343793,5900,petersampsonaudacity,2024-02-03T14:30:57Z,7) the dialog seems un- necessarily wide ![a link]
1925350442,5900,petersampsonaudacity,2024-02-03T14:57:39Z,"8) in the old clip-handle context menu the command was **change speed** - in the new menu it is just **pitch and speed**. surely it would be better to add back the ""**change**"" and make the new command be **change pitch and speed** a) for clarity of purpose (""does what it says on the tin"") b) to differentiate from the **render pitch and speed** just beneath it ![a link]"
1925351772,5900,petersampsonaudacity,2024-02-03T15:02:47Z,i have updated the manual for the changes as they currently are - but retained p1s just in case further changes are effected.
888245568,1377,Paul-Licameli,2021-07-28T11:49:25Z,"your approach is founded on a memory of the origin of a channel as ""aligned"" or not, rather than computing it as needed. i would prefer that you compute alignment as needed. defining the condition will take some work. you must sort clips of each channel, becauase they are not necessarily in sorted order, and they you must iterate corresponding clips comparing start and end times. (probably with a tolerance: let times differ by 1/(2*rate)) this is extra work, and extra calculation, but i believe the calculation will be small in practice because clips will be few. the advantage is greater confidence that there are not surprising corner cases where things will not work as expected. for instance: i just made a mono track, duplicated it, then made a stereo track from them. the affordance of the right channel did not disappear as expected in your branch. it would under this other approach. there are also other commands like ""swap stereo tracks."" this did not produce the expected result. it would if aligned-ness is computed instead of stored."
888279855,1377,vsverchinsky,2021-07-28T12:46:55Z,"i don't agree with that. i've considered that possibility, but the problem is that matching clips isn't enough, the result should be cached anyway. moreover the first case isn't valid, this behaviour was requested. the second case should be fixed. also i see a problem with definition of matching clips: it will probably change in the nearest feature."
888307713,1377,Paul-Licameli,2021-07-28T13:25:40Z,"if ""matching clips is not enough,"" what is your more precise description of the criterion? you are guessing it will ""probably"" change, but that is speculation. even if it does change, defining it in one place in a test seems to me to be the less fragile approach. more lines of code to implement the complicated test, but fewer places in the code will need changes to guarantee the consistency of the cache with changes of the track. caches are useful but problematic when there are many things that could happen to invalidate them."
888333440,1377,vsverchinsky,2021-07-28T14:00:44Z,"it is described here [a link] the check you propose is actually answers the question we don't need to answer (are clips aligned or not?). from the description of the task i understand that the sequence of track transformation determines whether the track should be considered ""aligned"" or not. consider case when user have stereo track with misalligned clips, then user makes them aligned by dragging. should we consider track aligned now? if yes, then affordance should disappear, if no then user can split stereo track and merge it back to get completely another appearance (this was my question for designers). and as i understand the currently implemented behaviour is exactly what was requested (except second scenario you've provided)."
888344119,1377,Paul-Licameli,2021-07-28T14:13:55Z,"you are right that you tried to implement literally what is now in the text box in the first picture at that issue. really i think that specification should be disputed and corrected. so, let's raise this at the next design review. i believe that if mono tracks have aligned clips according to the numerical criteria, then they should merge into a stereo track without the second affordance area."

1976846284,5965,Paul-Licameli,2024-03-04T15:29:17Z,please look at the two newest commits i'm afraid you might need to retest it all to be very sure
1096508598,2801,pietro68,2022-04-12T10:16:02Z,"i pushed some of the requested changes. i still have to fully understand why settings are not saved and recalled in commits 1, 2 & 3. so far i understood this: in those commits, the base class of echo is temporarily set to `effectwithsettings ` i put a breakpoint in void `shuttlegetautomation::define`; before and after those 3 commits, i see there that the values coming in, are the actual values set in the gui; with either of those 3 commits, i do not (they'd be the last saved ones) maybe this has to do with fetchparameters returning something wrong when the base class is `effectwithsettings `?"
1096608448,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-12T11:34:14Z,"let's be satisfied with persistency of settings in the final commit, even if it fails in the intermediate commits. i think the reason for failure is that makesettings() is redefined when you use the base class effectwithsettings, so effectmanager is storing a real settings object instead of an empty `any`. then there are calls to savesettings and loadsettings which really use that object. but while effectecho is not yet really stateless, it is still using its own internal copy of the settings instead of the one stored in effectmanager."
1096618504,2801,pietro68,2022-04-12T11:44:30Z,"i see now, thanks for the explanation. what do you think is left to do here? would you like me to reduce the number of steps from 4 to 3, like you hinted before?"
1097752082,2801,pietro68,2022-04-13T09:04:23Z,"the last push you see is after i rebased on branch `more-stateless-effect-utilities`, in order to try using `effectwithsettingsbase` to preserve settings in intermediate transformation steps (i.e. 1-2-3) but what i found out is that to preserve settings, i do not need that class. i just needed to correct fetchparameters to return the right address of the settings, and leave it there for all 3 intermediate steps. i verified it works for all 3 intermediate steps, and the 4th step works too."
1097964846,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-13T11:56:54Z,"i'm not persuaded that the transitional steps are really all correct. they may run the effect without crashing, but i think that at step 3, the effect does not apply the correct values. i could approve the pr anyway if the final result is correct, but i would prefer that you understand the intermediate steps well enough to know why bugs do or don't exist in them."
1098054294,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-13T13:31:02Z,"the third step does not apply settings correctly. it might also be useful to use the manage button to save a named preset. then verify that it is correctly retrieved when you load it, in each intermediate step. to make the intermediate steps strictly correct, you should not use effectsettings arguments of the instance, and should store a reference not a copy of settings in the validator, until the last commit changes that. you should not use effectwithsettings until the last commit, where you remove the msettings member of the effect."
1098055811,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-13T13:32:26Z,"my transformation of ladspa to statelessness does as i described, with other work too so there are more commits. i also don’t need effectwithsettingsbase at any point."
1098060872,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-13T13:36:42Z,this also means the places where the validator uses getsettings are not added until the last commit.
1098152914,2801,pietro68,2022-04-13T14:54:47Z,"i confirm that step 3 does not apply the chosen settings. i will edit each commit now, following these directives: a) for steps 1-3, inherit from statefulpertrackeffect b) for step 4, inherit from effectwithsettings c) in steps 1-3, have a msettings as a member of echo, and use exclusively that one d) in steps 1-3 in the validator, use a reference to the the settings, not a copy, but then in step 4 turn it to a copy is the above what you meant? it is not really clear to me how in step 3 i can access the effect's msettings member from within the instance - with a downcast to effectecho of the instance's mprocessor member?"
1098161008,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-13T15:01:47Z,"you understand correctly. static_cast of mprocessor is what i do too in the stateless-ladspa-effects branch. be sure msettings is deleted from the effect in the last commit, which will force you to make the other needed changes so that it continues to compile."
1098335889,2801,pietro68,2022-04-13T18:03:37Z,"some changes to the last agreed plan: step 2 could not inherit `statefulpertrackeffect` but had to inherit `effectwithsettings ` - otherwise validator implementations have no access to `getsettings()` step 3 could not inherit `statefulpertrackeffect` but had to inherit `effectwithsettings ` - otherwise there are no calls to the instance's process*** methods tests - preservation of last used settings: all steps pass - switching between user presets: steps 1-2-3 pass, step 4 shows a **bug**: when having two user presets a and b in the list, clicking once on one of them is not enough to change the values, the preset must be clicked twice. is this bug due to an error in assembling final step 4, or is the bug in the framework? i will have to inspect this tomorrow but if you have a hint, it is welcome!"
1098954808,2801,pietro68,2022-04-14T09:51:52Z,"i could reproduce the bug i noticed with the two user presets with dtmfgen too, so i conclude the cause is in the framework. i opened issue [a link] for that."
1098981984,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-14T10:06:28Z,no. getsettings() should not be used until the last step. i think i said that already. the parts of the validator code that use getsettings should wait until step 4 to be added. no. inheritance of the class changes only in the last step.
1099022405,2801,pietro68,2022-04-14T10:23:20Z,"alright, i can make step 2 still inherit `statefulpertrackeffect` if i comment out the calls to getsettings, not a big problem there. but... to make step3 inherit statefulpertrackeffect - i would have to leave processinitialize, processfinalize and processblock still belong to the effect and not to the instance. that's ok actually, it is just a little more work postponed to step 4. i found the preset switching bug also in dtmfgen, i opened this issue for it: [a link]"
1099056351,2801,Paul-Licameli,2022-04-14T10:42:38Z,are you sure the problem is in the framework? could it be a bug that already existed in 3.1?

1198389378,3258,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-28T16:43:56Z,"some general comments about the source and sink interfaces. see the looping task in processtrack. the task is between a source and a sink. to make progress, it must, in very general terms: - acquire an empty buffer from its sink (the loop begins in that state) -- ""sink.reserve"" - acquire a full buffer from its source -- ""source.produce"" - transform from source to sink (no-op because it's just in-place production into outbuffer) - release the buffer acquired from source -- ""source.advance"" or some better name (""source.recycle""?) - release the buffer acquired from sink -- ""sink.consume"" when we implement a concurrent pipeline in the future, there will be multiple concurrent tasks like this, each with an upstream ""source"" and downstream ""sink"". each buffer between tasks would have two blocks. each buffer has two associated semaphores, one signaled by the upstream task, one by the down. all the semaphores can count up to two. so each middle task will see two upstream semaphores and two down. effectstage::produce would instead become another task, and instead of returning, it would ""release"" a filled buffer of ready data back to its downstream. that's the sink.consume operation. (don't like the name?...) the downstream task would be unblocked from acquiring a full buffer, which is source.produce. (... but see how the names complement.) meanwhile the stage may be able to do work on the other block of the downstream buffer if it is free, concurrently with its downstream doing the transformation before releasing the buffer again. before the effect stage can do any of that, it must first ""sink.reserve"" an empy buffer from downstream. (all the semaphores that count free space begin with value 2, so initial progress can happen). it must also aquire data from upstream (that is already called ""source.produce""; there is an initial pipeline filling from ultimate source, in which not all cores are active yet). when all done, the stage must also ""source.advance"" to ""recycle"" the buffer space to its upstream again so its upstream is unblocked again from ""sink.reserve"" and can make more progress. maybe produce/consume can then be understood as complementary operations of cooperating tasks. the other two operations need some nice complementary names too, and maybe reserve/recycle isn't clear, so suggest better please. as for wavetracksink -- the conservative transformation i did here doesn't change its behavior of accumulating blocks until the buffer is full and only then writing them out, and so the function names seem strange. but maybe this isn't really achieving significant economies, and instead a rewrite for concurrency would really make consume act eagerly rather than have reserve make space lazily. the implementation can be changed under the interface."
1198397365,3258,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-28T16:52:11Z,"do you know anything about the four-stoke piston engine? i was wondering if there is a sort of analogy... - exhaust = reserve - intake = produce - compress = recycle ?

1198402092,3258,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-28T16:57:24Z,anyway.. maybe just acquire and release in each of the interfaces would be simplest.

1198825936,3258,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-29T02:50:12Z,"pushed again, with some name changes of functions and squashes of fixes; also last commit introduces audiograph::task"
846471056,918,Be-ing,2021-05-22T22:26:40Z,i am wondering this as well. will developers be able to build with the same builds of libraries locally that the official builds use?
846471614,918,Be-ing,2021-05-22T22:34:03Z,these libraries seem to be abandoned for many years. wrote a [a link] which may come in handy for you. maybe you could fork these old libraries and host them under the audacity github organization?
846528508,918,crsib,2021-05-23T08:55:47Z,"-ing it is already available :) the packages list is empty, because of some artifactory limitations i wasn't able to overcome - it simply doesn't list packages with anonymous access. you can browse the list here: [a link] or you can run [code block] and play with wxwidgets build using: [code block] we will have to :-) we have important patches in the build tree. likely i will do that early on monday"
846591839,918,Be-ing,2021-05-23T16:45:03Z,"so does this branch make cmake automatically download the library binaries from artifactory? if so, please document that and how to disable it."
846626816,918,crsib,2021-05-23T21:27:08Z,"-ing you mean you always want to build libraries from source? ok, that's not a problem. for package-maintainer-like cases, it is possible to share conan cache, but given that they will be forcing everything to system libraries, i don't think that it is much of an issue really."
846635214,918,Be-ing,2021-05-23T22:40:38Z,"i don't want to build the entire dependency graph from source. the default behavior i expect from a build system is to first search the system for dependencies. i think this should be the same whether building audacity locally or packaging it. i also want to be able to use the exact dependencies locally that are used for the official builds, which should be opt in. the documentation distinguishes between ""local"" and ""system"" libraries. i understand what ""system"" libraries mean, but how does conan fit into this? does conan automatically download builds of ""local"" libraries?"
846920048,918,crsib,2021-05-24T09:40:57Z,"this behavior can be activated using `-daudacity_lib_preference=system`. however, as i've mentioned earlier, this can be dangerous because there could be libraries with _official_ recipes from `conan.io` that will link to the conan provided zlib (or any other library), and you will have issues with the build. this is why this behavior is opt-in, not opt-out. if you turn library preference to **system** and you have the matching library installed and properly configured by the system maintainers the conan won't be used for the library at all. however, this will generally require you to install all the libraries and patched pkg-config files (if you are running ubuntu) for the dependencies, that are using conan - **local** will use conan provided library. that means that the recipe for the library will be downloaded from `conan.io` or our artifactory. if there are cached binaries for your system settings - the cached binaries will be downloaded. otherwise, the dependency will be built locally on your machine. in both cases, your local cache will be checked first."
846927351,918,Be-ing,2021-05-24T09:53:38Z,"i'm still confused. does `system` use conan as a fallback if the library is not found on the system? i suggest renaming `local` to `conan`. to me, `local` implies that no network connections will be made."
846930598,918,crsib,2021-05-24T09:59:27Z,"this is documented in this pull request, but i will further clarify it in the next commit. there is an option, that will force only using the system libraries. by default, if there is no system library - some fallback will be used. this pr does not replace all of the dependencies. this option can be renamed to **vendored**, but this will be confusing as well. the option will be renamed to conan when the work on dependencies is complete"

1044396256,2536,crsib,2022-02-18T11:49:39Z,there are different ways: 1. you can select a specific test as a run target on xcode (if you want to debug the failure) 2. you can build run_tests

(!) are we aware of this strangeness? i guess this should be raised as a separate issue. i was just curious if anyone had any thoughts."
1268397874,3696,DavidBailes,2022-10-05T12:54:34Z,"just to let you know that i've started to have a look at this. it clearly isn't complete, and i'll add detailed comments soon."
1271649248,3696,DavidBailes,2022-10-07T14:10:37Z,"some comments on the volume sliders: 1. the names of the sliders are currently ""record meter"" and ""play meter"". they are not meters! in 3.1.3 the names of the sliders in the mixer bar were ""recording volume"" and ""playback volume"". the current names should be changed to something similar to those in 3.1.3. 2. the step sizes for the arrow keys and page up/down keys are too big. they should be the same as in 3.1.3: step size of 1 percent for arrow keys, 20% for page up/down. 3. when as slider is the focus, the value of the slider is read by the screen reader periodically, for no good reason. this is caused by the value change event created in meterpanel::updateslidercontrol(). the creation of this event should be removed from this function. 4. when the sliders are changed using the keyboard, the new value is not read by screen readers. i presume that adding the creation of a value change event at some suitable point in meterpanel::setmixer() would fix that. comments on the class meterax: 1. this looks like it's only been partly changed to be appropriate to the sliders - for example, meterax::getname() is still the code from when this was a meter, not a slider. (code along these lines will be needed for the accessibility of the meter buttons ). 2. asliderax provides a good template for what meterax should be like. note that asliderax::getname() isn't actually needed, as windowaccessible::getname() does the same thing. 3. currently the behaviour of some of the member functions of meterax depends on the value of meterpanel::maccsilent, however this no longer needs to be the case, now that meterax represents a slider. meterpanel::maccsilent was introduced at commit 3d420e01, and may well be needed for the accessibility of the meter buttons. i'll add some comments on the meter buttons shortly."

(meterax now represents a slider, so meterax::getname() should be removed). with respect to fully transferring the fix in commit [a link] once the accessibility names of the buttons are correct, i can check whether anything further needs doing about this. there may need to be a minor modification to abuttonax to give it a silent mode."

1828500689,5685,LWinterberg,2023-11-27T19:54:00Z,"having a separate normal zoom and advanced zoom is an extremely poor allocation of functionality. another example of this are cut lines, which, despite having been introduced in 2006 iirc, have a mere 23 mentions in the forum. having these features and having them off by default adds a *lot* of complication for no real benefit for the *vast* majority of users. for spectrograms, steve was able to [a link] how the drag-to-zoom plays well into our other tools, namely the drag-to-make-box selection. hence why this pr enables it for that use by default. for waveforms, i do not see this this level of usefulness for the drag-to-zoom feature. what i do see however is a lack of functionality: if you have a recording or a stem at -10 or -20db or so, it currently is very hard to quickly zoom in while keeping the 0-line centered. this pr makes this much more used feature a lot faster. note that ctrl+scroll and shift+scroll are still possible and may be used to create all of the situations shown in this thread. for neither view i see a good argument to keep click-to-zoom-in, shift-click-to zoom-out or shift-right-click-to-reset. the former is *way* too easy to trigger accidentally and the latter two are stupidly hard to discover. just imagine, you just recorded something, accidentally clicked the vertical ruler and now it *looks* like your waveform is hopelessly off-center and clipping hard, and ctrl+z deletes the recording you just made. that's extremely panic-inducing, and we will not keep it, and certainly not by default. magnifying cursor implies click-to-zoom (compare to how browsers behave when viewing an image in a new tab). i use the default crosshair cursor here (which, aside, would be the correct one for the box selection in the spectrogram as well). but what i really need is a rotated i-beam-looking thing, or something else which is pretty clearly a horizontal line. that's a bug in my branch, i'll fix it. use ctrl+scroll in the meantime."

1566159151,4739,petersampsonaudacity,2023-05-28T14:36:18Z,a good point paul. so would you error trap that and offer to fix it by up-sampling to the higher of the two rates?

1566193837,4739,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-28T16:35:01Z,"is that really so? if there is in fact no frequency content above 1/2 of the lesser sample rate (the lesser of two nyquist frequencies), i think the sampling theorem tells us that theoretically you could down-sample from the from the higher rate to the lower, then up-sample again, without loss. practical calculations would truncate the tails of sinc functions though."
1566227637,4739,rbdannenberg,2023-05-28T18:47:21Z,"there's no inherent loss, but calculation is expensive. an old smith and gossett paper did an error analysis and said you need something like 50 multiply/adds and 50 accurate estimates of the sinc function to get 16-bit resolution (so even more for 20 or 24 bits). you can estimate the sinc function with interpolated table lookup, but that's two memory accesses, a float to int conversion (usually this is expensive) and additional float operations (times 50 or however many points you use) so it's much worse than just 50 multiply/adds. i don't think there are any tricks to do fast interpolated lookups. on the other hand, i think macos uses implicit sample rate conversion in core audio so that you can open an output device at any sample rate even while the device is playing a stream at some other rate. i wouldn't be surprised if they cut corners on conversion, and i strongly believe software sampling synthesizers do not do such high-quality conversion since the worst case numerically (e.g. full amplitude at 20khz) is not something you'll find in listenable audio, so you can normally get away with fewer points (i.e. a more truncated sync function). i don't know what's common practice, and people i've asked told me the details were trade secrets."
1566315083,4739,Paul-Licameli,2023-05-29T00:02:30Z,"thanks, roger! so, there is theory but then there is practice... and so quiet resampling is probably not a thing we should do and it isn’t what i did in this pull request."
1566728286,4739,crsib,2023-05-29T08:05:45Z,not to mention that it would further increase the storage requirements!
1566746674,4739,saintmatthieu,2023-05-29T08:20:21Z,"my guess on how most users would feel about the negative side effects of the various solutions : * quality loss: unaware, indifferent * memory increase: unaware, understanding * error pop-up: perplexed, annoyed, clueless i therefore would favour the silent conversion (both sampling-rate and bit-depth wise). whatever user is aware of the quality loss is probably tech savy and will find a way around it, or look a default behaviour she could change."
1566753497,4739,crsib,2023-05-29T08:27:14Z,"they are most certainly frustrated by the storage requirements, so definitely aware and not so understanding. resampling a track will effectively keep the old track on your drive before you close audacity (or even after, if you are unlucky), followed by a slow (and storage space demanding!) compaction. trying to join two tracks with different sample rates sounds like a very rare corner case. i would much prefer to have a descriptive error message here, probably coupled with ""resample to xxx"" button."
1566764608,4739,petersampsonaudacity,2023-05-29T08:37:27Z,"dmitry is right here : we see many cases/complaints on the forum (and here on github) about the ballooning sizes of projects - so to add to this with hidden automatic resampling seem absolutely not the right thing to do. and in the light of roger's comments _(and dmitry's earlier comments in this thread - and 's too)_ - i **_fully_** support dmitry's approach here - which is basically the approach that -licameli was originally pursuing with this pr ""fiix""."
1566783322,4739,saintmatthieu,2023-05-29T08:54:20Z,"true, but if a user wants to do this, gets the error message and knows how to solve the problem, she will probably proceed with resampling manually, resulting in the same memory increase, no?"
1566784837,4739,petersampsonaudacity,2023-05-29T08:55:54Z,a good decision. but note that we also have to deal with mis-matched formats - but -licameli is already aware of that. and consideration needs to be given to paul's earlier point about old projects already containing such stereo tracks with mis-matched rates and/or formats.
1566786988,4739,crsib,2023-05-29T08:57:14Z,"but it won't be implicit. on top of that, the user may want to resample to a lower rate, not to a higher one. or just to pan tracks accordingly (in case there are no plans to apply a stereo effect)"
1566805943,4739,saintmatthieu,2023-05-29T09:10:05Z,"i like the panning idea, and suggest that the error message one way or another indicates this workaround."

2653068252,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-12T09:09:15Z,". in [a link] it states that ""it’s important to note that uuids, while random, are considered ‘personal information’ under gdpr."" however, in this pr, both on the opt in/out dialog, and in application preferences it states that audacity does not store any personal information. i'm confused."
2653091115,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-12T09:19:12Z,anonimous is not the correct spelling of anonymous.
2653102668,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-12T09:23:38Z,"in application preferences, the send anonimous (anonymous) usage info check box is inside an ""update notifications"" group box, which having nothing to do with updates. also, this check box does not have an access key."
2653647525,8211,kryksyh,2025-02-12T13:00:49Z,that's a good point. we should group it differently or rename the group box.
2654254185,8211,kryksyh,2025-02-12T16:33:16Z,"thanks for the feedback! i have updated the message to be more correct: `audacity does not collect any personally identifiable information about you.` indeed! group name was renamed to ""network communications"" i fixed this too."
2655908475,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-13T08:50:43Z,"this is comment is about wording, rather than code, and so is probably principally directed at this is part of the dialog about updates and sending anonymous data: ![a link] in plain language, the question being asked of the user is whether they are happy to send anonymous usage data. that audacity is using a uuid is a technical detail that explains for those who are interested how the data is kept anonymous. but audacity could generate an uuid and send no data. a button with the name ""disable sending anonymous usage data"" rather than ""disable uuid"" would be much more easily understood by most users."
2656034038,8211,LWinterberg,2025-02-13T09:39:31Z,it unfortunately also would be incorrect as update checking would remain enabled.
2656069318,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-13T09:54:27Z,you mean because update checking also provides anonymous usage data?
2656190613,8211,dozzzzer,2025-02-13T10:41:08Z,tested
2656806560,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-13T14:41:04Z,"we could change it to 'don't send anonymous uuid', however, i kind of feel it won't make sense to anyone until they've read the description at the top, so we went for this more simplified version. although, in both cases, the option won't make sense to just about anyone if they don't read the text. also, just in case you were wondering - we decided to keep these notifications for update checking and uuid together because we think it'd get super annoying to have multiple back-to-back dialogs. most likely, the user would just spam the 'ok' button if we did that and be even less inclined to read each dialog. i guess i'm leaning towards leaving the button as is. there's also the issue of space / the buttons being really massive too. thoughts?"
2658720469,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-14T09:25:44Z,". having the two options in one dialog makes sense. often opting in/out of options such as these is done using check boxes, rather than buttons. this removes the issue of problems of size of buttons whilst trying to make their purpose clearly understandable. my understanding is that the new option you are introducing is whether the user is happy with sending the information of how often this particular copy of audacity is being used, where this information is being sent anonymously. what i definitely don't understand is the section in the privacy document relating to audio.com: if a user is signed into audio.com, then they already know how often that user is using the service don't they. so i don't know what the purpose is. linking an uuid with personal information so that the uuid is no longer anonymous doesn't sound like a good idea to me. currently, if a user upgrades to 3.7.2 from a previous version, then this dialog doesn't open. i'm not sure whether this is by design or not. but if it did, then i think the user would be puzzled about why they are being asked about update checking again."
2659236947,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-14T12:39:41Z,"first, given how we got buzzed a few years ago, we take a lot of time to be squeaky clean when it comes to gdpr and such, so if you spot any more unclear wording in the pp, please keep it coming. i'll send this to our lawyer to suggest a rewording for clarity. to your question, if you're on audio.com, you're obviously already signed in with your email and password. the uuid doesn't provide any additional personally identifying info because it's a randomly generated number. all it does is give us a better sense of overall retention and helps us understand the overall % of audacity sessions that include usage of audio.com. this simple detail tells us whether the combined service is healthy or not on a macro level. and just to be clear (for anyone reading who perhaps hasn't read the whole thread) - this is only if you choose to register on audio.com. --- about buttons vs checkbox: i have a lot of very boring things to say here about the inherent imbalance they cause one way or the other. we prefer a simple 'agree' 'don't agree' binary choice."
2659304834,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-14T13:10:35Z,it would be helpful if you could explain exactly how you are going to calculate the overall % of audacity sessions that include usage of audio.com.
2659877585,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-14T17:20:30Z,let me rephrase - the overall % of those who opt in to the uuid. we can't know about those that don't.
2660934828,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-15T13:55:42Z,"so is this right: you are wanting to calculate, for those who opt in to the uuid, the overall % of audacity sessions that include the usage of audio.com? as i've said above, an explanation of how you are going to calculate this would be helpful. if, for example, this involved audio.com being sent the uuid at the start of each session, then for those with an audio.com account that usage information would not be anonymous."
2660966190,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-15T15:14:06Z,"**one quick point on terminology:** regarding the message about uuids: under gdpr, a uuid alone is not classified as 'anonymous' data, even if collected without an ip address (and to clarify, we do not store an ip address with it). instead, it is considered pseudonymous data. for that reason, we avoid using the term ""anonymous"" when discussing the uuid. what we do state—accurately and in alignment with gdpr—is that we do not collect any personally identifying information (pii). **regarding the message itself:** the message is accurate for standard audacity usage. introducing details about what happens if a user later chooses to register on audio.com would overcomplicate the message to the point of making it very lengthy and unclear. instead, it makes more sense to provide additional details only when a user is introduced to an audio.com feature, by including a link to the audio.com privacy policy in all relevant places—which we already do. incidentally, we're expecting the revised audio.com privacy policy to be published next week. we're expecting to release at the end of this month."
2660988032,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-15T16:15:13Z,"ah, hold on, i see what you're saying now. the text in this build is including the word 'anonymous' still. that's a mistake. - we need to revise that. i think the figma mockup had outdated text in it. i can't seem to get this pr working but i see its merged, so let me grab master and see what the text actually says now and we'll replace the 'anonymous' parts with a correct description."
2663367636,8211,DavidBailes,2025-02-17T14:57:56Z,"in section 6 of the pp, it states that: we delete: uuid data immediately if you choose to disable it at any point i understand by that: if i disable the option of sending usage information in preferences, then all of my prior usage data held by you will be deleted immediately. is that actually going to be true?"
2663427153,8211,Tantacrul,2025-02-17T15:21:36Z,hmmm. it seems unlikely to me that it would delete all historical data immediately if the feature was simply disabled in the ui. i'd just expect the uuid to no longer be sent from that point onwards. i've reached out to the folk who wrote the policy to confirm this.
1914325959,5899,crsib,2024-01-29T09:47:26Z,"you have 12 threads and just a 5x speedup. the good question is why, but i probably need to examine the rest of the pr."

1914408727,5899,Paul-Licameli,2024-01-29T10:34:01Z,"speedup won't be ideal. there should be some serial component. or less than fully parallel, as in is the final merging step in which not all threads are doing work and there is inter-thread communication. you pointed out some cache ping-pong from false sharing. there is thread creation and destruction overhead because i didn't bother yet to invent or reuse a thread pool. there might be contention for a shared resource like the main memory bus or i/o. the estimated speedup was from 's regression test for tempo detection. in fact that test pulls entire files into big memory buffers first, then used to go sequentially through the memory, but now that can be fetched in a random-access way. the real-world tempo detection first creates a waveclip object, and then this parallelized version through the `miraudioreader` subclass will fetch sample blocks out of it, requiring database access."

1859210092,5789,petersampsonaudacity,2023-12-17T16:01:14Z,another way you could capture the start and end time of a selection is to give it a range label and then export labels to a text file. _possibly not so good of you already have a lot of labels._

1861059785,5789,lededev,2023-12-18T16:59:17Z,"if you put it there, you need 4 actions to complete this operation. move, click, move, click. and it will make the audio selection area lose focus. might as well click on the main menu to do this. my method is faster and requires only 2 actions, move and right click. considering that i also need to copy it to notepad, there are 4 keys including alt+tab and ctrl+v, or pure mouse actions also 4: move to notepad insert location, click, hold right mouse button and down gresture(paste), which require a total of 6 actions (8 actions using your method). since my notepadee has added the alt+2 function to do this, it only requires 4 actions in total, alt+tab, alt+2. i feel that if the operation is made too complex, i will be less interested in adding this small feature."
1862481335,5789,LWinterberg,2023-12-19T10:14:48Z,"i think the issue we're running into here is that there's a discontinuity between ""feature which makes my life easier"" and ""feature which fits into audacity"". i totally see your point that right-clicking the label makes things very fast for you. however, in the context of audacity and its millions of users, there are different constraints in place, which require compromise. one of these constraints is learnability and intuitiveness of the app. peter had the intuitive sense to look inside the selections gear to look for a copy option, so that could be argued as a sensible place to put this option. there would be other places too which would work intuitively for some people (ie ctrl+c - except that it clashes with us not having scoped shortcuts for most things, selection menu, context menu on the time display itself), and unfortunately, right-clicking or double-clicking *the label* to copy something else is just not something intuitive. and it's also not learnable as it's completely invisible and also the only place in the entire app that would do right-click copy. in fact, it would be unique among all apps i'm aware of; the only thing that comes close is some terminals using right-click to *paste*. so unfortunately, right-click copy is blocking the merge here. again, the feature itself is a good fit for audacity, and if put on a shortcut, it's be pretty fast as well."

1862890382,5789,petersampsonaudacity,2023-12-19T14:44:19Z,"yes, it's harmless there - but as leo says it ain't ""discoverable there, especially limited to the ""selection"" text in the toolbar. perhaps if you increased the target for the right click then users who may think to try for a context menu will stumble across it ![a link] that's something i certainly tried and failed - it was only when i happened to be over the ""selection"" text when i right-clicked that i got to copy dialog - but i failed to infer that that was the small target area. ================================================= you can't extend the right-click target further rightwards in the tool as as right-clicking in the two number zones brings up a context menu for display type ![a link]"

1047670383,2561,DavidBailes,2022-02-22T10:53:06Z,"thanks for removing the initial ""track"" from the accessibility name - that's much better. however, the accessibility name for label tracks needs improving, as it contains too much repetition, which can be very annoying. using 3.1.3 or earlier, the acc name of a label track with a default name would be something like ""track 4 label track"" using your branch the acc name of a newly created label track is something like ""4 labels1 label track"". in this case ""label track"" does not need appending, as the name of the track makes it clear that it contains labels. using your branch, if a project is opened which was created with 3.1.3 or earlier, and there are existing label tracks, then the acc name of one of these label tracks is something like ""4 label track label track"". again, ""label track"" does not need appending. so the appending of ""label track"" should be conditional. something like ""label track"" is appended except in the cases where the track name contains the string ""label"" or the string ""labels"" (not sure if the second case has to be included, i'm not sure how some non-english languages handle plurals)."
1047724714,2561,vsverchinsky,2022-02-22T12:00:42Z,"we can conditionally append ""label track"" to the name if it does not contain default name as its part. ""labels 1"" => ""labels 1"" ""my label"" => ""my label label track"" ""labels voice"" => ""labels voice"" is it ok? considering plural forms might overcomplicate things right now i believe."
1047815397,2561,DavidBailes,2022-02-22T13:49:12Z,"it's just about ok, but it would be better if label tracks created using 3.1.3 and earlier were not read as something like ""4 label track label track"". i'm not sure why you think it will overcomplicate things. the additional rule could just be if the name is ""label track"", then ""label track"" is not appended."
1047829571,2561,Paul-Licameli,2022-02-22T14:04:55Z,"to avoid overcomplication and implement something that works for all languages -- i would say scan for a singular string only, using the translation of the old internationalized strings formerly appended to the names if the migration from older audacity versions matters. this would miss ""labels"". there could be some special english only logic for that. doing plurals in every language would be hard."
1048542648,2561,DavidBailes,2022-02-23T08:25:31Z,"the accessibility name of a label track is now fine - for both current and previous versions of the default track name, ""label track"" is not appended. thanks."
1159098127,3070,Paul-Licameli,2022-06-17T17:35:09Z,that's a round of review. i understand this is still incomplete. two other boxes at least still to check off.
1168769609,3070,Paul-Licameli,2022-06-28T14:03:19Z,the commit that inserts calls to `fetchsettings` should also insert one at the end of `loaduserpreset`. i overlooked that in earlier rounds of review.
1170174990,3070,Paul-Licameli,2022-06-29T16:03:42Z,the latest version of the branch still has these omissions: - the commit that introduces call to `fetchsettings` still needs a call in `loaduserpreset`. - the `define makesettings` commit is only adding one boolen data member. (there was a more complete commit at 3af23e931425a532e790924ab8fcd8ae936aa661 in an earlier rebasing. something got lost.)
1825568327,5675,Paul-Licameli,2023-11-24T11:54:57Z,coincidentally preferences are a part of the program getting my attention now as a next frontier of refactoring to libraries. our drafts may conflict.
1825596557,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T12:18:53Z,but note that audio can still be shifted left of zero. in fact one can shift it to be completely left of zero such that it now becomes irretrievable!
1825613644,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T12:33:15Z,i have set p1s in the alpha manual for these potential changes
1825646100,5675,SteveDaulton,2023-11-24T13:01:21Z,"so will ""advanced vertical zooming"" be ""always enabled"", or ""always disabled""? (i use ""advanced vertical zooming"" very frequently, especially in spectrogram view, and would consider it a serious usability regression if it were permanently disabled.)"
1825667794,5675,SteveDaulton,2023-11-24T13:19:11Z,"if i recall correctly, about 4 years ago, this feature was accidentally broken during refactoring, and there was an outcry from users that the loss of typing to create labels severely impacted their workflow. the feature is important for workflows such as transcribing."
1825676586,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T13:26:41Z,"you could, while doing this also make it impossible to shift audio left of zero either a) just block it happening b) trim the clip from the left as a smart clip as it gets ""pushed past zero"" see this discussion thread: **why do we have negative time in audacity - do we need it? #4188**"
1825734929,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T14:14:21Z,"testing shows that it retains the value that was set in earlier audacity usage. if you set it ""on"" in 3.4.2 and then upgrade to 's branch build then int will remain ""on"" and available in that branch build. btw the same is true for the other ""hidden"" settings - and even the removed ""solo"" button which also retains its ""none"" state in the branch if previously set that way in 3.4.2 or earlier."
1825755535,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T14:31:33Z,"while you're at it leo, in **interface** preferences a) i think **show timeline tooltips** is redundant these days - it doesn't seem to do any thing. the manual says of it but timeline quickplay is always on these days afaict - and i only see **click and drag to define a looping region** when i hover over the timeline - and that is regardless of the setting for this pref _ you are (or were) the timeline king - does this make sense to you?_ ------------------------------------------------------- b) **show scrub ruler:** the [a link] can be displayed or hidden using this setting. this is a very obscure bit of audacity functionality - and only one of three ways to access audacity's scrubbing. we could probably ""remove"" or ""hide"" it as part of this prefs trimming exercise _(note that it eats valuable screen real-estate)_. -licameli may disagree -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i have added a p1 to the manual in case either of both of this is ""removed"" or ""hidden"""

1825783146,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-24T14:54:09Z,"nb, a reason this is a draft and most settings are merely hidden is for this to gauge interest and have it be easily reversible in the case that it's not . i wanted to do some more surveys about these next week, thanks for the pointers to the other things, i'll add them into this later"
1825796684,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T15:05:20Z,"i had guessed that to be the case (from the ""hidden"") _but note the persistence of these hidden settings from their use in earlier versions of audacity before upgrading._ thanks leo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- btw i throughly approve of a) removing the ""**none**"" setting for the solo button b) removing **enable dragging selection edges** - i can see no use case for having that turned off with regard to **enable scrolling left of zero** i think it is dangerous to hide/remove that while the user can still push audio into negative time. i can see both **advanced vertical zooming** and **type to create a label** potentially being contentious. _don't forget the current furore over the removal of a command/shortcut for **export selected audio** in 3.4.2_"
1825911356,5675,SteveDaulton,2023-11-24T16:47:28Z,"very much past tense ;-) the ""show timeline tooltips"" setting in preferences is broken. (tested on linux with 3.4.2 appimage)"
1825916838,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-24T16:53:55Z,i seem to recall that it was totally changed when new looping was introduced.
1826009161,5675,Paul-Licameli,2023-11-24T19:12:53Z,"i agree with steve that if this is removed from preferences, i would rather default it on not off. there is a checkbox to turn in on also in one of the view submenus, but that is less obvious. some very useful scrolling and zooming of the vertical rulers of waveform and spectrogram views are governed by this. it used to be just the default until james decided otherwise. which i never really liked, as a user."
1826018103,5675,Paul-Licameli,2023-11-24T19:24:55Z,"as for scrubbing, i’m proud of making it work in the audio engine, but i’m not attached to the ui design that never pleased everyone. actually scrubbing made code dependency tangles that i regret now..."
1826051521,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-24T20:06:12Z,"-licameli i see a good use case for advanced vertical scrolling in spectrogram view. i do not see a good use case for it in the waveform. in what situation do you not want 0 at the center in a waveform, or at the bottom in a half-wave?"
1826063003,5675,Paul-Licameli,2023-11-24T20:23:08Z,"if that is your opinion, which i might agree with. and you want to realize that in 3.5, it will need more work."
1829396124,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-28T09:13:00Z,"as it turns out, type-to-create-label is scoped to work only when a label track is in focus. given that's the case, i have absolutely no trouble with just having that functionality, without any setting for turning it off."
1829420182,5675,DavidBailes,2023-11-28T09:26:49Z,"but for users who don't wish to make use of the type to create a label functionality, it's much more convenient for them to have an option to turn it off so that they can use all the single character and shift + single character shortcuts when a label track is the focus."
1829500421,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-28T10:10:47Z,"do these users exist? i saw the mail threads regarding the introduction of direct typing in 2007 and then again a review in 2010 which introduced the preference, with you, peter, james and gale involved. between those dates, i see some talks about labels in the forum archives and some bug reports where the capture didn't work (for the letter z specifically), but i don't see any user complaints for the reverse - where they want to use a shortcut but get annoyed that a label appears instead. in the scope of this pr, i think it's useful to simply enable it by default and wait to see if anyone asks for it to be disabled. if a non-negligible amount of people appear, we can simply reinstate it for 3.5.1"
1829609318,5675,DavidBailes,2023-11-28T11:12:56Z,"users of screen readers? the option has been off by default since 2.3.2, over 4 years ago. the default was changed in this commit: f4aa75f4fc7b3e5c"
1829716442,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-28T12:10:03Z,"i was unable to find complaints about this in the audacity4blind archive. maybe freelist's search function let me down here though. the discussion in audacity-quality that lead to this change also appears mostly academical. that said, type to create labels does feel awkward together with the ""use dialogs for labels"" setting and i'm tempted to tie it to that instead."
1829758990,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-28T12:37:03Z,- so how do you see that working leo?
1829768598,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-28T12:43:07Z,"if you use the ""use dialogs"" setting, you have to summon the dialog via ctrl+b. if you don't have the setting active, then type to create labels is active."
1831782048,5675,LWinterberg,2023-11-29T12:14:28Z,"after further consideration, i'll just not touch the type to create labels preference for the time being. a ""transscription workspace"" may have some merit down the line."
1832337986,5675,Paul-Licameli,2023-11-29T16:59:12Z,"is it planned to disable the shifting of clips left of zero? but maybe that would impair your ability to make small latency corrections. maybe would support that opinion? if we simply disable the scrolling of the view left of zero, are we certain that really resolves all the issues linked above that relate to negative time? i don't know how the change of scrolling behavior would fix a bug in playback. but i have not yet reviewed changes."
1832382328,5675,petersampsonaudacity,2023-11-29T17:24:48Z,"-licameli in this discussion thread: **why do we have negative time in audacity - do we need it? #4188** wrote: of those two i would tend to favor option 2 and note that that would similarly allow for the ""small latency corrections"" that paul raises as a use-case - and in a non-destructive way **_but_** without the necessity for audio in negative time _(which will now be forever invisible to the user form 3.5.0 onwards)_. leo also wrote at the time, in that discussion thread: and i remain _**strongly**_ minded to agree with him"
1832390943,5675,SteveDaulton,2023-11-29T17:30:14Z,"personally i think that it would be better to allow ""zero"" on the timeline to be offset. not only would this allow ""small latency corrections"" to be made easily, but would also be handy for adding a ""count in"" before the start of the track. effectively you would have an ""absolute"" zero, which is the beginning of the track, and nothing is allowed before absolute zero, and there would be a ""local"" zero, which is where ""zero seconds"" / the ""start of the first bar"" are marked on the timeline. [code block] the amount of offset would be set by the user. for the benefit of novice users, the default offset could be zero, so that ""logical"" zero and ""absolute"" zero both occur at the start of the timeline. the minimum offset would be zero (""logical"" zero and ""absolute"" zero both occur at the start of the timeline). if the offset is adjusted, audio remains tied to the ""logical"" time. (this would mean that the offset can only be reduced when doing so does not put clips, notes or labels before absolute zero.)"
2095469553,6306,DavidBailes,2024-05-06T08:42:27Z,". in limitereditor::populateorexchange, it would be better if the accessibility names of the sliders were just the names of the properties, rather than also including the units, eg, just threshold, knee width, etc. for these sliders, screen readers read a percentage value between 0 and 100. if units are included in the accessibility name, eg db, then the user may mistakenly assume that the percentage value is the value in db."
2097702272,6306,saintmatthieu,2024-05-07T08:08:54Z,"thanks for pointing this out. on the other hand, the visual indication of the unit would be gone, and i haven't found an easy way of placing it somewhere else without affecting my current layout too much. i propose to keep an eye on this until the first version is merged and create a ticket then."
2097709650,6306,saintmatthieu,2024-05-07T08:12:45Z,closing in favour of #6395
2097769443,6306,DavidBailes,2024-05-07T08:44:45Z,"i think the code i was referring to may have changed, so i'll have another look when the first version is merged, as you suggested."

2569037469,7978,saintmatthieu,2025-01-03T10:51:42Z,"[a link] yes, i think the `timecodemodel` class must allow the `beatsformattermode` to be settable, probably as a q_property. then the playback-toolbar instance should set it to time-point, and the instances in the different generators should set it to duration. then i guess -gabriel in the unit test, you could probably keep the existing case (which assumes time-point) after setting time-point, and add your new one after having set it to duration."
2569046289,7978,embarc-gabriel,2025-01-03T10:59:00Z,yes! i will rework this. thx.

942839786,1865,Paul-Licameli,2021-10-14T01:02:12Z,done reviewing
947285284,1865,Paul-Licameli,2021-10-20T03:16:09Z,"maybe the generality is okay for ctrl+a and ctrl+c which do not need to push new undo items. but i have shown definite problems in case of paste. are there other problems to demonstrate with cut, too? maybe, i didn't experiment enough to decide that."
947293997,1865,Paul-Licameli,2021-10-20T03:30:39Z,"some experiments with ctrl+x when text is selected in a label track box, will easily show that proper undo/redo handling was already an omission even in 3.0.3 and earlier. was paste already badly handled too?"
947297039,1865,Paul-Licameli,2021-10-20T03:37:39Z,"actually, dopastetext() used to handle the case of insertion of text at the edit cursor of a label, always correctly pushing the undo stack. but this pr causes a definite regression of that behavior, preempting dopastetext()."
947566015,1865,vsverchinsky,2021-10-20T11:14:13Z,"yet another thing i overlooked, but the fix seems to be quite simple: move project history modification code to `labeltrackview::pastetext` and remove it from `onpastenewlabel`, `labeltrackview::oncontextmenu` (though history item text will change) and `dopastetext` becomes unneeded, so it can be removed. also, i've noticed that there is some gtk-specific code that does not modify undo history as well [code block] and it will be fixed too if the history modification code is moved to `labeltrackview::pastetext`, also `labeltrackview::cutselectedtext` may be fixed same way. do you think it would be better now to avoid changing existing code for labels, and add some workarounds to handle text shortcuts in wave track?"
1415849594,3996,Paul-Licameli,2023-02-03T13:09:04Z,i'm done reviewing. mostly good. but i had some questions.

1733576101,5239,crsib,2023-09-25T12:13:18Z,"in the original design, this dialog was quite a bit more complex: 1. it had ""apply destructively"" button, which is now a menu entry instead 2. there was a check box ""adjust clip when changing project tempo"", but it is not a priority now. so, probably the dialog will be extended even for 3.4, if ux testing proves that this feature is important. i would've done it using the dialog used now, but there was some miscommunication with the design team and i have implemented the ""apply destructively"" button before i was told it should be done differently."

1735335058,5239,chinakov,2023-09-26T11:19:57Z,"just an update on how 'render clip stretching' works with multiple stretched clips and selection within stretched clips. if a user has selected multiple stretched clips, and then accesses the clip menu - only one of the clips will be selected. if a user has selected a region within a clip, but not the entire clip, the user is forbidden from pressing 'render clip stretching'. hope this helps, somehow."

1191745287,3271,Paul-Licameli,2022-07-21T17:20:10Z,"moving `load` without `loadcommon` into the wrapper seems wrong. why were you trying to do it? i think the answer is that you wanted to avoid moving some data members into the wrapper. but i don't think it is necessary to avoid that. the wrapper class contains an aeffect handle, and that is right. each instance needs a different handle, and there is another scratch handle for the plug-in itself. the later part of `loadcommon` assigns mvstversion, mname, mvendor, minteractive, maudioins, maudioouts, mmidiins, mmidiouts, and mautomatable. these things are all ""metadata"" about the plug-in itself, not state of instances of plug-ins. the first two are already in the wrapper class, but now you skip the assignment of them for the plug-in -- another reason this pr is in error. for the rest, there is no reason why they can't be in the wrapper too, like mname. what about the early part of loadcommon? it assigns mrealpath, mcurrenteffectid, mpluginmain in the wrapper, and mpath, mbundleref, mresource, mmodule in the effect. the latter things are (platform specific) resource handles that keep the shared library of foreign code loaded into the process for as long as necessary. again, either you miss the assignment of things that were already in the wrapper, or else, you avoid moving things into the wrapper that are not part of instance state. so, i simply don't see your purpose of the splitting of load(). keep this work: there could be this benefit of this reexamination of load(), though i don't think it is necessary for vst2 statelessness. the things assigned inside loadcommon() really need to be assigned only once. they could be moved into a structure managed by a `shared_ptr` and that pointer can be in the wrapper. the effect object does the work of loadcommon only once. when the effect makes an instance, or the instance makes a slave, then the shared pointer can simply be copied, and the discovery of things inside loadcommon would not need to be repeated."
