(2) the notification to zk could take a long time if zk is not performing. doing the zk notification in a background thread reduces the potential latency impact to the client request. (3) we may implement a more sophisticated disk failure detection module (e.g., proactively verifying crcs in the log) in the future. having a diskfailurechannel allows us to integrate such a module easier (such a module only needs to interact directly with diskfailurechannel, instead of replicamanager). i agree that adding a separate disk failure handling thread adds a bit complexity, but probably not too much. to avoid building up the queue, perhaps diskfailurechannel can just maintain a disk dir set instead of a queue.",0,0.9851952195167542

128903738,2929,lindong28,2017-07-22T19:45:05Z,i have thought about this. we can do it if we add another 1-2 parameters to this method. this is because both the object `logdirfailurechannel` and `dir` in the body of `maybehandleioexception` belong to `log`. thus the `maybehandleioexception()` in its current form can not be static. it seems to me that the code is simpler by putting it only in log. we can move it to coreutils with the extra parameter if you think that is better.,0,0.9720141887664795

(since kafka_2_7_iv0 is the ibp where the feature versioning system gets activated) to answer your question, i'm not sure how to avoid the flip. it is to be noted that min version level changes are used only for feature version deprecation. due to the flipping values, it merely means some version levels would go a few times from deprecated -> available -> deprecated -> available...., until the ibp bump has been completed cluster-wide. i can't (yet) think of a case where the flip is dangerous, since: 1. we have this check: [a link] and 2. as best practice, we can recommend to not change a) minversion of supportedfeature as well as b) default minversionlevel within the same release. the reason being that we typically first deprecate a feature version level before we remove the code to drop support for it i.e. (b) usually has to happen before (a).",1,0.6473469734191895

(a short term benefit) - it matches how we do swapping in log cleaner (i am not very sure the benefit of following the existing swapping logic in log cleaner in this case though. can you explain a bit more?) - it can help us detect human error if the user mistakenly copied a directory with old data to a broker which already has directory for this partition on another log directory. cons of the suggested approach: - if we fail at the step 2 (rename currentlog to log.deleted), we will mark the partition offline even if we can use the partition in the destination log directory. this reduces availability of the partition. - if we fail at step 3 (rename log.completed to log), we will still delete the replica in the source log directory because it has been successfully renamed for deletion. this reduces the persistence of the partition. - extra logic is needed to keep completable logs in a separate map in logmanager so that we can include its size in the describelogdirsresponse. we also need extra metric tag for log whose directory has be renamed to log.completed. this adds complexity to kafka implementation in the long term. - it doesn't protect against more complicated errors, e.g. if user deletes new log directory before copying the old log directory, or if user deletes specific segment for the partition. overall i think the ability to detect some human error is nice to have. but human error detection is generally hard to do and we don't have a good definition for the scope of human error that can be detected. i am not sure if this is worth the cost in availability and code complexity. actually, if we do want to detect this specific human error, we can also modify the my approach to have broker refuse to start if the same partition appears in more than one directory. this will generate false positive only if source log directory fails exactly at the time the destination partition has caught up with the source partition, which should be pretty. since user knows the log directory that was offline, he/she can manually delete the partition in the source log directory correctly and restart the broker. the reply is a bit long. thanks for taking time to read and discuss this issue.",0,0.9655525088310242

140683628,3874,junrao,2017-09-25T03:34:28Z,": your suggested approach probably works in the common case. my concerns are the following. (1) log truncation is a relatively rare event. your approach tries to solve the problem by requiring writes to future log to hold on to the lock to the current log on every write. so, we add overhead in the common path to solve a rare event. intuitively, to solve a rare event, we also want to add overhead in the rare path. (2) your approach won't be able to distinguish leader epoch inconsistency due to log truncation or bugs in kafka. in the latter case, we probably want to error out instead of continuing. (3) the dealing with leader epoch is tricky to reason about and is already done during replica initialization in the replicaalterdirthread. if possible, it would be useful to limit the places that we deal with leader epoch directly. (4) in theory, even if a topic has the new message format, a truncation may bring the log to the point where there is only old message. (5) intuitively, the disk balancing feature seems independent of message format. so, it feels a bit weird to require that. as for the concerns that you mentioned on the suggested approach. i am not sure we need to hold partition.leaderisrupdatelock. that lock is only needed when the replica set changes. truncating an existing future replica doesn't change replica set though. we do want to make sure that the reinitialization in the future replica is synchronized properly with potential concurrent alterlogdir requests, as you pointed out. so, the following is a slightly modified approach. after the replicafetchthread truncates the log, it will do the following: (1) call a new method in replicaalterdirthread.addpartitionswithtruncation that takes a partition and a truncating offset. this method won't directly do truncation in the future replica. it simply sets the partition state to be truncating if the partition is still present in the partition map. when replicaalterdirthread sees this new state, it ignores any pending fetch response and truncates the future log to the truncating offset, and then resumes fetching. addpartitionswithtruncation() needs to hold partitionmaplock. however, since only replicafetchthread.truncation can call replicaalterdirthread.addpartitionswithtruncation, but not vice versa. there is no cycle to form a deadlock. this approach seems to address all the above concerns: (1) no additional overhead in the write path, which is common, (2), (3) no additional logic for dealing with leader epoch, (4) and (5) doesn't require new message format. neither approach deals with the case when a truncation only happens on the current replica, but not the future replica, and the broker dies. this can still lead to the case when the future replica's log can be ahead of the current replica. if the message format doesn't have the leader epoch, this may not be dealt with cleanly during future replica initialization. we could potentially just truncate the future replica to the log end offset of the current replica in that case during recovery.",0,0.9652783870697021

[code block] for this case we materialize the derived table from the filter() and we get a proper `filter-changelog-topic` and we can pass this one. [code block] for this case, the agg result ktable is materialized and we can pass the `agg-changelog-topic` as name. [code block] for this case, the agg result ktable is materialized and we can pass the `agg-changelog-topic` as name, because the filter() does not change the schema. thus, even if the join-input ktable is not materialized, we can avoid to leak anything by ""borrowing"" the upstream changelog topic name of the filter input ktable. [code block] for this case, we need to materialize the result of `mapvalues()` and get a proper changelog topic for the join-input table. [code block] this might be a weird case, for which the base table is materialized, while the input join-table would not be materialized, and also the type changes via mapvalues(). hence, the `table-topic` schema is not the same as the join schema and we also don't have a changelog topic for the join-input ktable. we still use the changelog-topic name of the non-existent changelog topic (of the mapvalues() result ktable). as you can see, we can cover a large scope of cases for which we don't leak anything and can always use a topic name that contains data corresponding to the schema. does this explain my thoughts?",0,0.9762988686561584

[code block] an alternative option could have been to allow the user to pass in the `materialized` instance itself (like we do in the `reduce` function). the problem with that alternative is that the java api expects `java.lang.long` as the value serde, while the scala api needs to take a `scala.long`. and there is no way we can convert a `materialized.as[k, scala.long, bytearraykeyvaluestore]` to `materialized.as[k, java.lang.long, bytearraykeyvaluestore]` without a cast. hence the divergence in the api signature between `count` and `reduce`. please share if u have any other thoughts.",0,0.9902419447898865

(this has the benefit of also testing the bulk of the `streamtask` implementation.) so, it'd be great if this test driver could pass the consumer for state manager into the `streamtask` constructor took a consumer (or consumer supplier) so that the tests can inject mocks instead; the `streamtask` constructor already takes a consumer and producer, so taking a second consumer for state management seems consistent. right now `streamtask` is the only thing that constructs a `processingcontextimpl`, so passing the consumer down also seem reasonable. this approach also seems to have minimal impact on other code, and imo is better than passing a flag into the processor state manager's constructor or calling a method on the processor state manager, since right now the the `processorstatemanager` is constructed within the `processingcontextimpl` class which itself is constructed within the `streamtask` constructor. btw, the test driver class and a unit test is ready for a pr, except that the tests that use state management are failing right now because it's trying to create a real consumer for state management. i'll go ahead and make the aforementioned change to pass in the consumer, fix my tests, and submit a pr for review first thing tomorrow.",0,0.706994891166687

(e.g. `altertopics()`) 2. a method to only move replicas within a broker. (e.g. `alterreplicadir`) btw, i still feel that having (1) is sufficient. it would be useful to explore possibility of only having (1) so users don't need to deal with two different interfaces for replica movement. with that, regarding this patch, i was thinking doing the following: 1. let `reassignpartitioncommand` take new input format which includes the log dir. 2. do a sanity check in the `reassignparititioncommand` to ensure no intra broker replica movement is specified. otherwise throw `unsupportedoperationexception`. 3. in `reassignpartitioncommand`, it should just send `changereplicadirrequest` to the related brokers before the partition movement. 4. do not add `alterreplicadir()` to the adminclient until the broker supports that. would the above way be sufficient for what we want to achieve for this patch?",0,0.9868707656860352

206930443,5201,bbejeck,2018-08-01T15:38:42Z,"great question. in building the topology graph, it's not possible for a graph node to not have a parent. it is easier for me to explain the logic best with some examples. first, let's consider no repartitioning [code block] in this case we a repartition did not occur in `dojoin`, so the `thisstreamsgraphnode` and `otherstreamsgraphnode`, from the `lhs` and `other` `kstream` instances respectively, represent the graph nodes for `streama` and `streamb` and the parent node is `root`. anything created directly from the `streambuilder` always has the parent node of `root`. if a `kstream` instance is created by another upstream operation like `builder.stream(""topicb"").filter(...)` , then its parent would be the graph node representing the `filter` operation. in this case in the `thisstreamsgraphnode` and `parentgraphnode` are the same instance, and it ends up with two child nodes, the `thiswindowedstreamsnode` and the `joingraphnode`. i prefer to keep these two nodes separate as we don't need to keep track of repartitioning, i find the logic more clear to use the graph nodes from the `lhs` and `other` `kstream` instances. next repartitioning is required: [code block] now a repartition occurred in `dojoin` and the `thisstreamsgraphnode` is now a repartition graph node, with its parent being the `selectkey` graph node and the grandparent node is the original `streama` graph node. if `streamb` had required a repartition the parent-child structure would be the same, the `otherstreamsgraphnode` would be a repartition node with the parent being the graph node representing the key changing operation and the grandparent node representing the original `streamb` graph node. so at all times the `thisstreamsgraphnode` and `otherstreamsgraphnode` have parents of either `root` or some other upstream `kstream` operation and the `thisstreamsgraphnode` and `otherstreamsgraphnode` need to add the respective window stream processor graph nodes as children, so the physical plan is rendered correctly. does this make sense?",1,0.946773886680603

42831631,165,becketqin,2015-10-23T04:03:50Z,"good point about the correlation with rebalance listener methods. you are right, we should make them consistent. it looks we are trying to address two different kinds of programmers: 1. people who are using kafkaconsumer. 2. people who are developing their clients(producer/consumer/processor, etc) and extending abstractcoordinator. majority of the programmers belongs to (1). what they need to provides today are: - consumerrebalancelistener - `onparitionsrevoked()` - `onparitionsassigned()` - partitionassignor - `assign()` - `onassignment()` - `subscription()` the programmers in case (2) need to think about: - `ongroupjoinstart()` - `generateassignment()` - `ongroupjoinend()` to make everything consistent, perhaps we can change the consumerrebalancelistener interface to: - consumerrebalancelistener - `ongroupjoinstart()` - `ongroupjoinend()` as said in kafka-2674, my only concern about this approach is that if later on we want to add a `beforecommittingoffset()` to rebalance listener, that's going to be a bit weird. but there is always a workaround to turn off auto commit and let user have full control over the state when `ongroupjoinstart` is called. so i guess this is less a problem. does this approach make sense? btw, wrt **leave**, here is my understandings about onleave() if we have one. if we have an onleave(), it should only be called when a consumer has been kicked out of the group, i.e. its generation id is no longer valid. otherwise, the consumer is technically still in the group. that means onleave() should not be called during a normal rebalance because the generation id is still valid.",1,0.8094258904457092

234144660,5821,hzxa21,2018-11-16T09:48:12Z,"this is a very good point. i think it is fine because the bounced broker will reject the control requests anyway because the cached broker epoch has not been updated yet. however, this brings up another question: do we actually need to call `onbrokerfailure()` for bounced brokers? after a second thought, i think the answer is no because the end goal of controller handling bounced brokers in brokerchange event is to make sure the quickly bounced brokers will be initialized correctly and the end partition/replica states will be the same with and without calling `onbrokerfailure` for the bounced brokers (if there are no new brokers and dead brokers). in this case, only calling `onbrokerstartup` is sufficient. invoking `onbrokerfailure` first is a correct and safe option but it comes with some overhead because we need to perform leader election and send out the stopreplica/leaderandisr/updatemetadata, which are not necessary. previously i thought that missing `onbrokerfailure` will cause correctness issue because we might miss some state clean up but looks like it is not the case. also note that if we use controlled shutdown to shutdown and restart the broker, the leadership election actually happens before processing the brokerchangeevent. tl;dr: to be more specific for your original question (why updating the live brokers first then invoke `onbrokerfailure` is fine), there are three places where we use the live brokers informartion in `onbrokerfailure`: 1. determine whether we need to transition partition states to offlinepartition: since at the time of the brokerchange event processing, the bounced brokers are alive so there will not be offline partitions. 2. determine which brokers we want to consider when performing leader election in `partitionstatemachine.triggeronlinepartitionstatechange()`: since the bounced brokers are online at that time so we should consider them. 3. determine which brokers we need to send out control requests and which brokers we need to include in the live brokers field in updatemetadatarequest: since the bounced brokers will not accept control requests anyway so the first point doesn't matter. for the second point, the bounced brokers are live so we don't want to exclude them in the updatemetadatarequest.",1,0.5359353423118591

234307011,5821,lindong28,2018-11-16T18:36:20Z,"regarding info vs. warn, i usually follow the summary in [a link] which says that info level is for `generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc)`, and warn level is for `anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which i am automatically recovering`. in this case the `brokerepoch < cachedbrokerepoch` can happen only under rare scenario when controlledshutdownrequest is re-sent due to disconnection between broker and controller. this is similar to the scenarios captured in `networkclient.processdisconnection(...)` which are currently logged in warn level. and it is unlike all other info level logging in kafka for normal broker start/stop. so it seems that warn level is appropriate here?",0,0.9939334988594055

236902108,5821,junrao,2018-11-28T00:36:16Z,": overall, i agree with your assessment that the onbrokerfailure() call seems redundant. the only thing is that it can force a leader epoch change. suppose that broker 1 is a bounced broker and is the current leader. if we skip onbrokerfailure(), the controller just keeps broker 1 as the leader w/o bumping the leader epoch. this means that the follower won't go through leader epoch based log truncation, which maybe needed since broker 1 may not have all the data in its local log after the bounce. so, perhaps we can't skip onbrokerfailure(). the next question is should the live broker list exclude the bounced brokers when we call onbrokerfailure(). it seems that we should since live broker list influences which broker is the new leader. if the bounced brokers are still in the live broker list and are the current leaders, those leaders' epoch won't change. so, in summary, it seems that we should still call onbrokerfailure() but excluding bounced brokers from live broker list first. we then add the bounced brokers to live broker list and call onbrokerstartup().",0,0.9909977912902832

39107202,195,junrao,2015-09-09T22:55:07Z,"parth, zk watchers are actually one-timer watchers ([a link] when a watcher fires, the client has to register the watcher again (typically through a read) to get notification for future changes. between the time that a watcher fires and the client does a read, multiple changes could have happened. the read will return the latest value and leave a watcher there. so, in general, there is no guarantee that every change triggers the firing of a watcher. in particular, if you update the value of a zk path multiple times in between, only the latest value will be seen by the reader. one way to capture all changes is to follow how we propagate the config changes (configchangelistener). whenever we change an acl, we write the acl under /kafka-acl and also write a sequential zk node under /kafka-acl-changed. the value of the sequential zk node indicates the resource for which the acl has changed. the sequential zk nodes are guaranteed to be unique and have a number suffix that's ever growing. the acl manager registers a child change listener on /kafka-acl-changed and remembers the last number suffix that it has processed. when the watcher fires, the acl manager reads all child nodes under /kafka-acl-changed (the read may pick up multiple acl changes) and process new nodes after the last remembered number suffix. the processing will involve reading the latest acl associated with the corresponding resource. since every sequential node is unique, the acl manager won't miss any acl change. on initialization, the acl manager will first register the watcher and read all existing acls. finally, we need a way to garbage collect old sequential nodes. this can be done by just removing sequential nodes that are say, more than 15 mins old (assuming every broker would have picked up the acl changes by then).",0,0.9856512546539307
