320955151,358,Crisspl,2019-09-04T20:18:28Z,what? i dont get it
320955552,358,Crisspl,2019-09-04T20:19:29Z,so what should i do with transform feedback? i mean this `new_meshes` is not a solution

323817636,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-12T15:49:14Z,"in vulkan the layout contains information about the byte-ranges of push constant storage used (and by which shader) not the actual data to use nor backing storage for it, just an array of ranges (so the implementation can compute how much data needs to be reserved for a pipeline, and do some mappings, hopefully to registers). for opengl we don't specifically need to know about the ranges used (since we always provide only 128 bytes of storage), but for vulkan its mandatory. plus who knows? this sort of info may make the mapping between byte-offset to opengl non-ubo uniform easier!"
323820399,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-12T15:54:38Z,"its not really duplicated. ok so you have attribute slot (vertex input id) <-> buffer binding (api buffer input id) <-> buffer this basically means that there's a switchboard for buffer connections. the duplication isnt really a duplication, first its a mapping of attribute input slot to binding, and then binding to buffer input. i.e. you can predeclare that uv, color, etc. attributes at inputs 1,2 come from buffer binding 1 with different offset and stride and position+normal attributes at inputs 0,3 come from buffer binding 0 with different offset and stride. this is also why there is a relative-offset field, so you can use the same buffer binding for different attributes. this allows for less api talk and faster switching (less validation). possibly even vertex cache improvements on shitty half-assed implemententations. instead of the current system where its 1 buffer binding per 1 attribute"

324160301,358,Crisspl,2019-09-13T12:02:06Z,also maybe you could explain it to me because i can find the info.. whats going on about that there can be more than one immutable samplers in one binding? how are they used if there are more than one?
324204192,358,Crisspl,2019-09-13T13:53:48Z,ah nvm xd i guess imm samples count must be equal to descriptor count (within binding)
324205151,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-13T13:55:47Z,yes exactly.
324208809,358,Crisspl,2019-09-13T14:03:57Z,hm do we want to have the same enum values as in vulkan's enum?
324210325,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-13T14:07:26Z,"nah, just enough bits to be able to store that amount of distinct enums"
324416115,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T07:43:34Z,do we have a query for supported formats for tbo? also call it `addbufferview`
324416130,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T07:44:05Z,why did we need `idriver::remove*` functions in the first place and just not be able to `drop()` stuff?
324419832,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T10:13:13Z,"you don't need a refcounted array here, just let people set it to plain pointers. you won't be holding that array after the function returns. only use refcounted pointers if you will hold the pointee after function returns."
324419867,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T10:14:54Z,"you can already do the copy of attributes `type`,`count`,`stageflags` in this loop and compute the first half of the offset as well."
324419910,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T10:16:56Z,isn't the syntax `core::make_refctd_dynamic_array ` ? did i fuck up that function?
324421016,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:03:11Z,"make sure sizeof is 4, or use typed uint32_t enums"
324421081,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:05:21Z,missing location and binding field (only one of tem can be implicit)
324421111,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:06:18Z,"you dont have a `binding` field, that's necessary"
324421160,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:07:54Z,"there's no need for a malloc'ed array, just store a `uint16_t enabledbindingflags;` next to `enabledattribflags` the max binding count is 16."
324421183,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:08:21Z,anonymouse struct and serialize/deserialize methods
324421187,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:08:36Z,you need more bits for the future blend ops
324421369,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:15:03Z,ok we cant support separable sample from image
324421377,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:15:25Z,cant support image/texture without smapler
324421397,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:16:04Z,we can support this in two ways: - descriptor set with immutable sampler - descriptor set with combined image+sampler
324421573,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:23:42Z,"don't set a max anymore, on anything"
324421576,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:23:54Z,let us query
324421586,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:24:21Z,"if you're gonna grab and drop things, use smart ptr"
324421647,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:27:03Z,"`ivulkanprebaked`is not correct cause descriptor set is mutable after creation (just not after bind, and there are extensions that take this constraint away) also don't use virtual inheritance when not needed"
324421665,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:27:57Z,same for the other objects. remember we want to use `ext_descriptor_indexing` in the future.
324421684,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:28:56Z,why havent we nuked this entire file yet?

324421720,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:29:45Z,`.get()` ?
324421733,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:30:21Z,evtt_buffer_object should disappear from the engine
324421754,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:31:26Z,"now that we have descriptor sets, this thing can be replaced in its entirety (remember about the layout compatibility rules from vulkan spec!)"
324421860,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:36:05Z,"also, there needs to be two separate caches in `cnulldriver` one for compute and one for graphics pipeline (changing descriptors on one shouldn't influence the other), but copengldriver must make it play with the fact that there are no separate bind points for graphics and compute (changing the set changes both)"
324421931,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:39:52Z,"this file/class shouldn't exist, there's no such thing as a ""storage image"" object in vulkan, its just a binding in the descriptor set. [a link] i know you need to create `imageview` opengl objects, but like vaos they are non shareable between contexts, so need a driver-wide cache for them :( with the key being `pair ` there is however a `imageview` (same as texture view in opengl) but thats my responsibility to implement."
324422061,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:45:07Z,no a buffer view is not a texture!
324422137,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T11:48:13Z,"~rebindrevalidate used to recreate the binding between the tbo object and a buffer that's changed on the opengl side, now if you detect a change you should just remove the tbo object , recreate it with the changes and then update the descriptor set (the descriptor set layout must be created with allow update after bind).~ never mind, this is the driver not the skinned mesh. i would recommend nuking `sauxcontext::setactivetexture` and similar, then just introducing a `sauxcontext::setgraphicspipeline`, `sauxcontext::setcomputepipeline`, and `sauxcontext::setdescriptorset`."
324422438,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T12:00:45Z,(only in opengl and under the hood)
324430291,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T16:51:17Z,"yea, it's temporary solution. but now i think that i can make only copenglbufferview inherit from irenderablevirtualtexture. it has to be be like this because of sauxcontext::setactivetexture()"
324430365,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T16:53:50Z,this file shouldn't exist anyway
324430517,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T16:57:56Z,what about vertex attrib buffer bindings (described by params in pipeline) in meshbuffer? should there still be limit of 16 and relation binding_num=attrib_num?
324430653,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:02:16Z,so we still want to have max vertex attrib buffer bindings limit of 16?
324430688,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:03:33Z,binding field is redundant because index in the array is supposed to denote binding num
324430740,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:04:59Z,"nah, it's not :c"
324430808,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:07:01Z,"hm, right, thanks"
324430848,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:08:12Z,because they're cached in cnulldriver and remove*() removes the object from cache
324430881,358,Crisspl,2019-09-14T17:08:55Z,"nah, but there should be such. i'll make later"
324440354,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:48:22Z,nuke `sauxcontext::setactivetexture()`
324440359,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:48:39Z,+1
324440386,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:50:11Z,"as per our discord conversation, i do not believe there should ba a cache of already created objects... especially if they are actually shareable. there's probably no reason for this cache to exist. or other caches."
324440392,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:50:31Z,lemme know when changed.
324440396,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:50:48Z,so i fucked up ?
324440409,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:51:27Z,"nope, the index in the array denotes the `location` not the binding (which buffer binding provides the attribute for the current location)"
324440421,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:51:58Z,"theoretically they could be different (one lower, one higher) but they are usually not so."
324440442,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:53:06Z,"yes, vertex attrib buffer bindings are not descriptors. neither are subpass inputs (really). other bindings with `ext_descriptor_indexing` you could have 512k textures bound at once."
324440448,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-14T22:53:23Z,idescriptorset ?
324467401,358,Crisspl,2019-09-15T15:03:36Z,"yes, its not mine. mine is in include/irr/asset"
324467546,358,Crisspl,2019-09-15T15:06:40Z,so there still limit of 16 attrib buffer bindings? then why array index cannot denote binding num?
324467676,358,Crisspl,2019-09-15T15:10:09Z,[a link] until now we had convention that binding_num=location (attrib num). so why would we drop this if nothing changes here?
324477803,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-15T19:38:48Z,"sorry, it must be an abomination created by me"
324477827,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-15T19:39:17Z,this will no longer be our contention
324477844,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-15T19:39:36Z,"faster buffer rebinding, probably better hardware cache usage."
324607370,358,Crisspl,2019-09-16T10:42:26Z,why actually?
324615222,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T11:04:02Z,"because you'll be setting the entire descriptor set at once, and the descriptors bound in previous bindings determine the gl-bindings of the textures you'll be setting as the result"
324617611,358,Crisspl,2019-09-16T11:11:11Z,"apparently, if you wanted it differently. see your code with usage of it: [a link]"
324621497,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T11:21:58Z,i think i've fucked up slightly would have been more sane to use`core::make_refctd_dynamic_array ::gpuobjecttype> >` on that particular line and throughout the engine
324622278,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T11:24:22Z,"actually no i didn't fuck up, had to have it like that so `make_refctd_dynamic_array` could be used to create both `smart_refctd_dynamic_array` and `refctd_dynamic_array`s"
324728435,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:06:22Z,these could be uint8_t and some others
324728515,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:06:32Z,any reason not to?
324729606,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:08:22Z,"actually will be 6, because bitfield can't straddle type boundaries"
324735490,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:19:42Z,remember there is also a per-meshbuffer buffer binding offset to be implemented [a link]
324736048,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:20:47Z,call this field `relativeoffset` also could fit this and `binding` in a `uint16_t` because there are limits for each value much lower than 64k
324744669,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:37:16Z,need offsets as well
324747401,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:42:42Z,handle id > max
324747453,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:42:47Z,handle id > max
324750913,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:49:30Z,alignas to avx512
324751323,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T15:50:22Z,why the push constants only in igpumeshbuffer and not icpumeshbuffer ?
324861734,358,Crisspl,2019-09-16T20:06:58Z,because they're dynamic thing (most likely changes very often) so i think exporting them (as asset to file) is rather pointless
324889042,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:14:48Z,keeping a cache with a key of raw-pointer will necessitate icpushaders letting know the `cshaderintrospector` that they're being destroyed... maybe a smart pointer would be better (but then you need methods to kill the cache entries)
324890213,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:17:49Z,i don't want to see grab and drops in the engine anymore
324890240,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:17:53Z,i don't want to see grab and drops in the engine anymore
324890812,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:19:26Z,why isn't `dointrospection` returning a `core::smart_refctd_ptr ` right away?
324893003,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:25:06Z,`asset` namespace violation (cannot depend on `video`)... just analyse whether the spir-v had debug info and `assert` that it did. also doesn't the requirement that debug info is available make it impossible to use .spv pulled off the web?
324893390,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:26:09Z,pass the version instead of whole driver... also should the version be a static var of `copenglextensionhandler` ?
324893921,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:27:38Z,actually you need to introspect if the layout qualifier `row_major` applies to that particular push_constant
324894203,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:28:22Z,"`vector` is a malloc, use an `std::array` with an upper bound in size"
324894309,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:28:38Z,or some stack scratch space
324894445,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:28:55Z,dont use vector
324897190,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:36:54Z,"remember that if `top.name` is the name of a variable thats an array you need to query for `top.name+""[0]""`"
324897866,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:38:57Z,find out if the offsets into the push_constant range need to be somehow aligned for the types (on the glsl side) and put some assertions here
324898078,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T21:39:34Z,how are the uniforms sorted? by location or by offset in pc-range?
324907070,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-16T22:07:56Z,"there's probably no harm in being able serializing them... plus actually their use can be very very static (non-dynamic) because of a desire to re-use command buffers, and once recorded pcs can't change (have to record another cmd buffer), so i'd actually see them being used for super high-frequency (less overhead than dynamic ubo offset) but small and static (for the mesh) data, such as objectids, material ids, colors, booleans, and other switches."
324934255,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:05:03Z,"i would if someone could give me upper bound :p really, is there any expectable?"
324934356,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:05:35Z,"oh, right, thx"
324934699,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:07:16Z,"_pcdata is supposed to be already offset'd range of those 128 bytes, but not sure if i understand u correctly"
324934986,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:08:50Z,"i haven't tried to make them sorted anyhow, but seems like they are in order they appear in uniform block, so location"
324935434,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:11:13Z,"yea, i thought about that, but left it for tomorrow. actually there are spv decorations for it, it's nice. i'll add to introspection data"
324935818,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:13:21Z,k i don't like global vars so ill make a parameter for it anyway
324936331,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:15:51Z,"yes, i wrote it in the docs in iglslcompiler, but there's no other way to set push constants in opengl backend"
324936534,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:16:48Z,because it doesn't need to.. no greater purpose really
324937120,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T00:20:07Z,"well, pointer is just an integer and introspector isn't trying to access pointed address. there's no need of knowing whether the icpushader actually exist"
325040305,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T08:26:31Z,128 bytes?
325040874,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T08:27:50Z,"im pretty sure that the `col` pointer needs to have ome sort of alignment before you pass it to setuniform, i.e. 4 bytes or something"
325040979,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T08:28:02Z,i'd sort them
325041219,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T08:28:32Z,+1
325041793,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T08:29:52Z,"yes, you can just make the production of debug data default to true + assert or fail to produce the opengl gpu shader if introspection tells us there are push constants but no debug data to know their names."

325173349,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T13:42:34Z,so max size of 4x4 matrix array is 2? i dont get it
325185538,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T14:03:36Z,most of these are 32bits because i'm trying to make them look as close as possible to vulkan's structs
325186306,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T14:04:50Z,"hm, yea, so ill better make introspector hold them"
325215968,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T14:54:10Z,"yes, if our max size of push constant data supported by the engine is 128, then you can have max 2 matrices."
325216492,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T14:55:02Z,then you also need functions to purge this cache (so creating icpushader does not create actual memory leaks)
325216996,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T14:55:52Z,we won't be able to `memcpy` this into a vulkan struct anyway cause `e_format` doesn't match `vkformat`
325256303,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T16:06:30Z,"i was thinking totally in abstraction of this.. ok, doable if we have some global constant with max push constants bytesize"
325263786,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-17T16:21:34Z,"yeah best that way, so no alloc here, this is the hot loop"

325421968,358,Crisspl,2019-09-17T23:03:26Z,and what do you think about this
325539427,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-18T08:14:51Z,why do you need this cache in the first place? make a `removefromcache(copenglspecializedshader)` and `clearcache()`

327012827,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-23T09:09:17Z,"here's a way to do it #25 ideally you want to protect every opengl call that is likely to happen every frame (so almost all done by copengldriver) with `if (nextvalue!=currentvalue)` so that you're not pounding opengl calls pointlessly. when you want to change opengl state (current pipeline, rop params, vao, vao input buffers, etc. ), dont actually change it straight away, have a deferred change mechanism. obviously there are a few exceptions that cannot be done like this, most notably setting framebuffers and push constants (these need to be immediate, not deferred). sidenote, framebuffer change is a big call with big cost, so users will be careful not to call it recklessly. basically you want to avoid a performance penalty when user or implementation sets descriptor bindings to null, and then binds own descriptor sets. same for vao, and vao buffer bindings, etc. because what would happen, is first (probably multiple) `extglbind*(0)` calls before a bind call that actually binds an object. what you want to do, is to track some of the state (not all opengl state) that is relevant to things you're going to be deferring. so you have a current-state (last flushed) cache, and a next-state cache (values that you will set to if `flushstate` is called). then when your `setactivedescriptorset` and similar calls take place, you modify the ""next-state"" (which holds opengl values you will change to). this means that while your smart pointers to front irr api objects may change, etc. opengl will not be called until it is time. only when you call `flushstate` will you check if next opengl values are different from current opengl values and call the opengl functions if necessary, then update the current state values. **don't worry about opengl objects being deleted while having their handles on ""next-state"" thats a user error.** implement a `sauxcontext::flushstate(sauxcontext::gl_state_bits, copenglstate* optoutcurrentstate)` that will change the current state to next-state and fill out the copenglstate (already in the engine) class/struct with appropriate data (so it doesn't need to `glget` query it). expose an `idriver::flushallstate()` that will call `sauxcontext::flushstate(sauxcontext::gsb_all,nullptr)` under the hood. people won't usually have to call that, as push constants, {multi}dispatch{indirect} and {multi}draw{indirect} will do it under the hood for them. my proposal for the flags is (you should also flush/update the opengl state in the order of the flags, most costly to least) [code block] also a `sauxcontext::notifyofstate(const copenglstate& externallychangedstate)` could be useful for interop with middlewares (set the current state cache to that which is reported)."

328093541,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T12:31:50Z,"yea, but user doesn't bind descriptor sets. they're taken from 4 places in the engine (global,camera,scenenode,meshbuffer) and bound automatically. that's why i came up with an idea to have dynamic offsets in idescriptorset"

328171120,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:53:43Z,you can actually kill the emulation code for that.
328171595,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:54:32Z,still explain?
328171848,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:54:59Z,lets not have these maximums anymore
328172097,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:55:22Z,this makes me happy
328172184,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:55:31Z,any reason not to improve on it?
328172372,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:55:51Z,ok leave as is
328173684,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T14:58:05Z,remind me what's the true parameter?
328187412,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T15:21:59Z,ok now im confused about the design
328188519,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T15:24:04Z,so that i can call multibind call just once and instantly also unbind anything other than current descriptor sets' descriptors

328272506,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:22:19Z,you no longer need to cache samplers

328282420,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:44:23Z,parameter buffer also needed (gl_parameter_buffer) and a driver feature query (some externsion or gl 4.6)

328284031,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:48:06Z,"i'd rather pay for max 4 multibinds (1 per set), rather than have a dynamic allocation here every frame. these maximums will either be too small, or large enough to overflow a stack."

328327094,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:34:07Z,whats the difference really
328327385,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:34:44Z,this grab is needed here
328327744,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:35:30Z,renamed long ago
328327979,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:36:03Z,this drop is needed here

328328891,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:38:07Z,this look completely different now
328329011,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:38:24Z,in upcoming commit
328329210,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:38:52Z,ok
328329575,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:39:39Z,"no idea why, but will do some time"
328329742,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:39:57Z,y
328330025,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T20:40:34Z,is it question? idk what i can say here
328368814,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:35:53Z,why arent you dealing with smart pointers in the first place?
328369421,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:38:21Z,less code = make code review easier
328369552,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T22:38:48Z,read the code and u'll know why im doing this
328369560,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:38:50Z,space taken by enum in structs
328370067,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:40:46Z,id assume that an opengl function taking a type t will fuck up if pointer is not aligned to alingof(t) would be nice to at least have an assert
328370224,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:41:22Z,how doo you remove stuff from caches that are not vaos ?
328370437,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:42:14Z,same issue as here [a link]
328371246,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T22:45:39Z,"copenglspecializedshader has its object-local cache for as we talked few days before, and theres no other than vao caches in copengldriver/sauxctx created by me. there will be cache for pipelines though ofc.. and deletion will look same as it lloks for vaos, so in `copengldriver::cleanupcontextbeforedelete()`"
328371583,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:47:05Z,`ivideodriver::setdescriptorsets` needs to take a(n): - enum graphics vs compute - pipeline layout - first desc set ix - desc set count - up to 4 desc sets - dynamic offset count - dynamic offset array pointer excerpt from spec:
328372535,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:50:46Z,elaborate?
328372548,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T22:50:51Z,"yea, but now i dont see point of those descriptor sets in [global],camera,scenenode,meshbuf if user has api to bind them directly"
328373320,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T22:54:06Z,the point of is to make the `scene` namespace usable `video` namespace must be independent of `scene` this is so we can have things like instanved scene nodes while having total access to the opengl 4.3-4.6 and vulkan api ( have our cake and eat it)
328374770,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T23:00:44Z,"example: we have bound desc set which occupies ssbo binding points 0,1,2 another desc set is going to be bound at the same index which occupies just ssbo binding point 0. do i have to unbind ssbos from binding points 1 and 2?"
328375385,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:03:19Z,best try and nuke it... afaik its irrlicht's poor counterpart to our state flush
328375630,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:04:30Z,correct buffer clears on opengl wont take place if write masks are not enabled
328375657,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T23:04:37Z,"scene namespace requires video namespace, so it is usable without ""[global],camera,scenenode,meshbuf"" if there is api to bind descriptor sets. also: how engine decides which descriptor sets to bind? those from scenenode, meshbuffer, etc.. or the ones explicitly bound by user with api?"
328375699,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:04:48Z,also necessar for color clears
328375749,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:05:02Z,its just a flush afaik
328376086,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:06:32Z,"just like `setmaterial` scenenode::render() sets the `setmaterial` by default, if user comes in and does their own `setmaterial` then we use that."
328376468,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:08:17Z,"""[global],camera,scenenode,meshbuf"" this stuff i only want to be considered at the `scene` namespace level. remember `smaterial` in meshbuffers? nothing in `video` set the material from meshbuffer for you! `setmaterial` had to be called before `draw`, `draw` did not automagically set the material for you from the meshbuffer, even though the meshbuffer had it!"
328376793,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:09:52Z,why switch and not an array like above?
328376890,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:10:25Z,const static
328377673,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:14:09Z,"i think resetrenderstates used to mean, flush state to default first chance you get basically resetrenderstates=true would be the equivalent of setting the next graphics pipeline state to its default values (although thats crazy inefficient and pointless most of the time)"
328377728,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:14:24Z,set next graphics state to default.
328381145,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:30:06Z,"yes you do, but it still comes out at 5 multibinds top. this is why, descriptor sets n, n+1, ... will be disturbed by pipeline compatibility rules if the cumulative total of opengl bindpoint (ubo, ssbo) bindings will be different for descriptor set n . hence first a>=0 decriptor sets will be undisturbed, then b>=0 descriptor sets starting at index a will be disturbed (replaced by null descriptor set), then c>=0 descriptor sets starting at index a+b will be replaced, then d>=0 descriptor sets starting at index a+b+c will be disturbed. a particular set can only stay wholly bound or wholly disturbed. `a` needs to equal a *contiguous* subset starting at 0 of ""identically defined"" sets common in previous and current pipeline. so range a and b each must encompass whole descriptor sets in the current pipeline layout (not the old), c naturally encompasses whole descriptor sets by definition, whereas d encompasses the difference between the end of the old total binding range and new total binding range. note that d>0 if and only if current pipeline layout has more descriptors of a particular type than the old pipeline layout. is it clear? you just need the previous pipeline layout to figure out the indices and the ranges."
328381469,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:31:34Z,flush of a current state set to the default state was actually to implicitly enable depth and color masks as well as disable rasterizer discard ( a few things that would mess with framebuffer clearing and blitting)
328381569,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T23:31:58Z,the optimize comment is about the fact that not everything really needed to be reset to default
328382478,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T23:35:53Z,it comes down to this [a link]
328383597,358,Crisspl,2019-09-25T23:41:34Z,"so its just setting a few blending parameters. is it even worth doing anything? especially hen we dont have `e_material_type` (`emt_*`) any more ? + you sure it means ""reset to default"" and not ""run some gl calls again no matter what""?"
328449492,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-26T06:17:33Z,"it means reset to default. its to avoid a nasty suprise when clearing the color and depth/stencil attachments. you can read glclearbuffer* and `glblit*` documentation and see that `glenable(gl_rasterizer_discard)` as well as depth,stenil,and color masks affect which channels get cleared if any (`glclearbuffer*` actually gets treated like a render call). the parameter here used to be ""reset everything to default"" but it as obviously overkill. alternatively instead of resetting this stuff here, you could reset it in the clear and blit functions (then reset back to the original in the next draw)."
328450032,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-26T06:19:34Z,killed the `material_max_textures` variable?
328451222,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-26T06:23:09Z,will you also clear the pipeline cache same as vao when you get too much in cache? also what about framebuffer cache?
328451668,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-26T06:25:03Z,this would be unbind all descriptor sets
328452065,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-26T06:26:54Z,"frambuffersrgb is always true, and non debatable (shouldn't even be in the state)"

329347605,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:14:53Z,"yes, but i set it to false a long time ago before i understood the probable benefits."
329348145,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:27:23Z,you can nuke `e_4x3_transformation_state` and `e_projection_transformation_state` and just do a built-in include with the default definition of a per-camera and per-scene node descriptor set (ubos only really)
329348189,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:29:04Z,you can also kill all `draw2d*` functions

329348528,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:39:24Z,why do you stil need this storage?
329348548,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:40:08Z,you can do bind new and unbind old at the same time.
329348586,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-29T10:41:45Z,why would it be necessary to unbind completely before setting new samplers and textures

333178554,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T18:55:15Z,ok but what about the immutable samper stuff?
333179561,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T18:57:28Z,so your code supports both immutable and mutable combined sampler (an image/texture + sampler pair) ?
333179782,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T18:57:59Z,so that whole expensive loop is just because the immutable cpu sampler needs to be swapped for a gpu sampler?

333180937,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:00:23Z,just compare pointers
333181175,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:00:58Z,or does vulkan spec say otherwise? (pretty sure it really cares about object handles to immutalbe samplers being identical)
333188510,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:18:34Z,you need to compare field by field.
333189296,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:20:31Z,still need the driver feature queries for these things
333190383,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:23:10Z,"wait what!? you got it wrong, vulkan counts from index 0 not backwards! loop should be `for (uint32_t i=0u; i<compatibilitylimit; i++)`"
333191149,358,Crisspl,2019-10-09T19:25:04Z,well yea ofc but obviously mutable sampler is in descriptor set
333192456,358,Crisspl,2019-10-09T19:28:11Z,"same place as it was before, copengldriver::initdriver() or something like this"
333192789,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:29:03Z,"maybe make `uint32_t _dynoffsetcount, const uint32_t* _dynoffsets` into just a smart refctd array passed by r-value, then add a smart refcounted dynamic array member `dynamicoffsets[4]` to `nextstate` this shouldn't ever be a problem as if layout changes (is incompatible) then the dynamic offsets will be dropped, its 100% the case that if the dynamic offset arrays are different lengths the pipelines will be incompatible. you can still compare the contents of two identical length dynamic offset arrays, and decide whether to refresh the bindings or not. or you can just keep a copy of the offset array (base offset + dynamic) for multibind of buffers (you'll recompute every `binddescriptorsets`) but only ever fire off the multibind if something changes"
333193442,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:30:44Z,the use of `std::copy` and stack arrays is still pointless here.
333193548,358,Crisspl,2019-10-09T19:31:01Z,"vulkan just says that descriptor sets has to be ""identically defined"" and not sure what this means. but you might be right that immutable samplers names has to be the same"
333204559,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T19:58:10Z,"this is still an issue in the latest commit. to recap only the following are possible: # everything changes then you do 1 multibind per resource type x (ubo,ssbo,texture) with `count = previous pipeline layout total count of resource of type x across all descriptor sets`, since you're unbinding all array/pointer parameters to opengl multibind functions can be `nullptr` # n (>0) descriptor sets stay the same (after validation rules) there are two stages to this, bind new and unbind old. ## bind new nullptr (no descriptor) counts as a ""new"" descriptor binding. then you do 1 multibind per resource type x per new descriptor set bound, with `first = previous pipeline layout total count of resource of type x across descriptor sets in slots [0,n)` the pointer/array parameters shall be sourced **directly** from precomputed (if desc. set nullptr, then parameters are nullptr) arrays inside the new descriptor sets in slots [n, n + new descriptor set count] ## unbind old for every resource type x, you take the difference between `previous pipeline layout total count of resource of type x across all descriptor sets` and `new pipeline layout total count of resource of type x across all descriptor sets` if the difference is positive (previous layout had more bindings, then you do 1 multibind per resource type x (ubo,ssbo,texture) with `first = previous pipeline layout total count of resource of type x across all descriptor sets` and `count = the above mentioned difference`, since you're unbinding all array/pointer parameters to opengl multibind functions can be `nullptr`"
333205661,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T20:01:02Z,all the other `copengldriver::clear*` need similar state setting
333206042,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T20:02:06Z,you also need to disable rasterizer discard state

333238326,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T21:18:49Z,ok it just looked a bit like it was designed for immutable sampler only.
333238520,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-09T21:19:21Z,i think comparing handles is more strict so less likely to run into problems that way.
333275271,358,Crisspl,2019-10-09T23:27:34Z,"well now when i think more about this, i think its completely fucked approach. `bindgraphicspipeline()` shouldnt touch descriptor sets at all, and `binddescriptorsets()` should get extra param `_pipelinelayout` (just like vulkan function has). however vulkan spec says i cant know which pipeline layout was used to bind descriptor set unless we have a requirement that before every call to `bindgraphicspipeline()` must go *maximum* of 1 call to `binddescriptorsets()` (then i know that all bound descriptor sets were bound with pipeline layout compatible with layout of currently bound pipeline) this seems far more tricky than i thought at first look.. and im not sure i understand it correctly"
333283036,358,Crisspl,2019-10-10T00:04:41Z,"probably yes, i cant see other reason now"
333403665,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-10T08:57:20Z,"as much as i would like that to be the case, its the behaviour under the vulkan spec. that is also a valid approach. well in my current proposal if `bindgraphicspipeline` call unbinds no longer compatible descriptor sets (but without flushing state) then by the time you come around with `binddescriptorsets` you are 100% sure that any non-null bound descriptor sets are compatible with the currently bound pipeline. its a similar situation to calling something akin to `binddescriptorsets(....,driver->getcurrentpipeline()->getlayout)` , vulkan only takes the pipeline layout parameter to bind descriptor sets to count the hardware binding indices properly for opengl es 3.2 class hardware."

333682833,358,Crisspl,2019-10-10T18:54:24Z,not sure if needed
333688709,358,Crisspl,2019-10-10T19:07:38Z,i dont know what u mean
333754318,358,Crisspl,2019-10-10T22:02:53Z,"sprimitiveassemblyparams::primitiverestartenable and sprimitiveassemblyparams is obviously member of irenderpassindependentpipeline, corresponds to `vkpipelineinputassemblystatecreateinfo::primitiverestartenable` which is member of `vkgraphicspipelinecreateinfo `"
333882980,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T08:32:27Z,disable: - rasterizer discard - scissor test enable: - color write mask (color clear) - depth write mask (depth clear) - stencil write mask both front and back (stencil clear)
333883275,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T08:33:11Z,kill them
333884610,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T08:36:44Z,since textures and multisample textures are share-able there should be no reason for us to track them in the driver.
333884936,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T08:37:38Z,lets not track it then
333887559,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T08:44:33Z,setting and bringing back state is what the clear itself is supposed to do. i don't think there's any reason anymore for the `setrendertarget` to do anything.
333900318,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:17:00Z,"wait, what why?"
333900897,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:18:20Z,its wrong... again
333905318,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:29:13Z,remove `edt_sampler` and `edt_sampled_image`
333914570,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:52:09Z,"first replace everything with `matrix***simd` types, then # for people and parts of the engine only using the `video` namespace `whatever/path/we/have/for/builtins/defaultcameradata.glsl` [code block] `whatever/path/we/have/for/builtins/defaultscenenodedata.glsl` [code block] `whatever/path/we/have/for/builtins/defaultcameraubo/location/${loc}.glsl` [code block] `whatever/path/we/have/for/builtins/defaultscenenodeubo/location/${loc}.glsl` [code block] then people will need to know to push new data (via streaming update or upload everything up-front then rebind at different offset before every draw). # fixing the `scene` namespace will be piss-easy. we allow each scene node to hold a descriptor set + offsets, and also the scene manager (the global desc set). [code block] now the difference is that during the override of `iscenenode::render()` the camera scene node will bind its descriptor set to slot 1, but a regular scene node will bind to slot 2. any meshbufferscenenode will take the descriptor set + dynamic offsets attached to a meshbuffer and bind it to slot 3, as well as push the constants just before the draw. and obviously `iscenemanager::drawall()` shall begin by binding descriptor set to slot 0. ## how the data will be updated we will need a `scene::descriptorsetupdater` class and a default instantiation of it that will run after `iscenenode::onanimate()` is finished, think of it like an animation call-back. i see a method like `scene::descriptorsetupdater::update(scene::iscenenode*,video::igpudescriptorset*,core::smart_refctd_dynamic_array * offsets)` the default one for cameras will stream update the buffer in location 0 at offset assigned with the matrices as expected by the `defaultperviewubo`. the default one for mesh scene nodes will do the same for `defaultperscenenodeubo`. user can derive and make a different descriptor-set-updater. i plan to replace this prototype with something much faster when i come to do #96 and bucket-rendering."
333914880,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:52:59Z,"ok, cool then i can resolve."
333915833,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:55:40Z,"i can't see where in the code you're purging that cache, it just grows without bound."
333916397,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T09:57:12Z,"well the vector is sorted by hash, so the lru removal is unfortunately a linear search xd not sure you could do any worse with a map"

333938872,358,Crisspl,2019-10-11T11:04:01Z,i meant key type is now smart_refctd_ptr
333973151,358,Crisspl,2019-10-11T12:47:29Z,idk what i meant by this really. now i simplified it to what you wrote here [a link] but optimized a little (if prev and curr pipeline layouts are compatible for set n and `currstate.set[n]==nextstate.set[n]` then binding set n would be redundant)
334028646,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T14:46:30Z,"had slight vulkan spec clarification, written down in #376"
334029290,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T14:47:42Z,i think we agreed that we need `arb_multi_bind` from now on.
334029752,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T14:48:42Z,we need to talk this over in person (call) and come to some sort of a conclusion in #376
334030129,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T14:49:33Z,great but need to be able to purge the cache totally as well as have the engine purge it periodically.
334066621,358,Crisspl,2019-10-11T16:07:48Z,cshaderintrospector isnt supposed to be one global object. it's not even refcounted. see how its used in copengldriver::creategpuspecializedshader()

334074158,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T16:27:51Z,ok that clears it up for me
334074346,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-11T16:28:22Z,kill it

334256080,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-12T22:58:54Z,i would put the generic tracking here.
334416227,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-14T10:27:02Z,seriously.
334416723,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-14T10:28:32Z,not quite (they are combined maxes across all pipeline stages) but they aren't obscene.
334418111,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-14T10:32:34Z,i'd actually move that up to cnull driver.
334420738,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-14T10:40:49Z,just make sure we never gluseprogram and we'll be ok.
334438041,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-14T11:35:01Z,need setshader and other [raster] params (but layout is immutable)
334517945,358,Crisspl,2019-10-14T14:44:46Z,that would require dividing gl state tracking (which is per-context) into copengldriver and cnulldriver.. practically undoable

336349501,358,Crisspl,2019-10-18T07:18:48Z,"yes, that's what docs say this is one i don't understand at all. why are you talking about mesh data format desc and what vao has to do with all this?"
336351052,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T07:23:38Z,"mostly for the vulkan implementation since you need a `vkdevice` parameter to `vkupdatedescriptorsets`. you can fill it with descriptors 1 binding at a time (or several) see the struct [a link] or you can copy from other descriptor sets (or several) [a link] you can update at any binding if you look at the above structs nope you can update as many times as you like, see the structs above. order of update doesn't matter as long as the updates don't overlap/overwrite. the cpu version you can update as much as you like, the gpu version you can update until you bind it before a draw for the first time, or you create it with an extension that allows for ""update after bind"". but main logic here under vulkan is that you cannot update the descriptor set while its being used for drawing, before or after is fine."
336351500,358,Crisspl,2019-10-18T07:25:03Z,ah ok i got the english syntax now xd the point of removing calling this `remove` function is that pipeline's shaders gl names might be reused once shaders gets destroyed. so there is a possibility that some new pipeline would get the same hash while the old pipeline's hash still exist in the cache. this would end up in finding pipeline gl name consisting of not-anymore existing shaders (invalid gl names)
336351563,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T07:25:13Z,because my old api didn't have this threading requirement and thats how i want the new one to be.
336352018,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T07:26:42Z,ah indeed.
336355667,358,Crisspl,2019-10-18T07:38:25Z,[a link] do you get it now?
336358770,358,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T07:47:34Z,but if you're using smart_refctd_ptr in the per-context pipeline cache the old shaders (and their gl names) will not be destroyed until you remove the pipeline (and drop the shaders) hence you won't be able to get the same gl handles as long as the pipeline is in the cache.
336487668,358,Crisspl,2019-10-18T13:22:27Z,"going that way, hash for pipeline can be just `smart_refctd_ptr `"

386296771,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-02T10:02:30Z,"yeah, about this, for efficient computation it would make more sense to: 1) find unique trees (different roots) 2) for every tree, do post-order traversal on the cpu to figure out the order in which bsdf nodes would get evaluated for establishing the normal to use for shading: 3) error out if more than one (can be the same over and over) `bumpmap` bsdf node gets used in the tree (we don't want to be wasting time on that) 4) record normal tangent frames (max 2, and first one is the smooth non displaced one) to be used for shading and evaluate them at the start of the `bsdf_` functions (all the angles and cosines) 5) for every node in the bsdf tree tag which shading normal tangent frame its going to be using (only need 1 bit). for the `bsdf_sample` functions: 6) you don't need a stack, every single time you hit a blend bsdf node, you will pick the left or right child according to the `sample.x` and the proportion of the left to right child blend weight, then you will sample the child with `sample.x = (sample.x-pre_cdf)/chosen_pdf; sample.xy = sample.yx;` (rescaled random numbers) and bump the output value by `1.0/chosen_pdf` iteratively until you hit a leaf node. for the bsdf_eval function: 7) when popping the bsdf node from the post-order traversal stack in hte cpu offline preprocessing step, find out the max-stack-size (for all trees, so you can only define that value via specialization constant after you've constructed all the bsdf trees) for the ubershader (with assumption that a parent blend node moves the resultant value onto the stack replacing the leftmost child). 8) for every tree, record the nodes in the order they would have gotten **popped off the stack** and record the offset in the per-invocation-local-stack where they would have stored their result (for the blend node, do not store children indices, but stack-offsets to consume)."
386297865,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-02T10:04:47Z,good idea.

387492427,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-04T07:40:18Z,mask we can turn into a bit-option just like twosided

387750424,424,Crisspl,2020-03-04T15:40:58Z,mask is getting translated into blend with fully transparent bsdf
387855992,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-04T18:35:17Z,i think it will be cheaper to just make it into a bitfield option and stick the rgb19e7 weight / bindless texture handle at the very end of the bsdf parameter table.

389306353,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-07T19:34:47Z,"i'd split the allocation logic from the texture packing logic into two different classes that later come together (we might want to re-use the packing logic for on-line gpu resource streaming, with no intermediate cpu objects). also we will re-use the packer for real virtual texturing (you need to pack the virtual addresses into one virtual texture) and the megaimg will never exist then."

392614167,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-14T19:46:38Z,"well, no why? the page table is a regular texture. if you allocate a texture which is (16,16) pages, then due to morton code + alignment it can only have an offset that is a multiple of its size ;) hence possible offset you'd get allocated in the base mip would be (0/8/16/24/32/....,0/8/16/24/32/....) the remaining mip level offsets you can infer by dividing th base leve offset by `exp2(miplevel)` , because of magical alignment and the quadtree-like structure you will never suffer from integer truncation. obviously when you get to the 1x1 page tile level, you stop needing to worry about the remaining mip levels (we'll make sure the next 2 contiguous pages get allocated for a mip tail) just make sure you mark that page table entry with the `tail_bit` flag (which still leaves you with enough bits to address 2*1024*1024*1024 separate physical pages, which is insane - or 32k if you use 16bit physical table pointers which would still allow you to keep 512 megapixels resident in memory with a 128x128 page tile)."
392631203,424,Crisspl,2020-03-15T00:46:08Z,"ah, you're talking about page table. this code here is allocation of tiles into physical texture"
392654793,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-15T09:08:10Z,square address allocator is for virtual address pooladdressallocator with no alignment at all is for physical pages and the only value being saves should be a uint16_t ;)
392656420,424,Crisspl,2020-03-15T09:31:48Z,"oh, allocation is done a lot different than you wanted it then xd actually now i see more sense to it. luckily it's no problem to change it"
392825456,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T07:22:00Z,~just store it as `uint16_t[2]` to make life easier~
392825783,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T07:23:08Z,waaait.... `stexoffset` is a offset into virtual uv space (page table).... you don't store the `uint16_t` offset pair here... that goes into the page table!
392826080,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T07:24:03Z,`stexoffset` is still supposed to be 32bit and use full precision here ;)
392826450,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T07:25:13Z,"make the `x()`, `y()` and `layer()` functions of `stexoffset` be handled via the texture packer (so it can pass through the bit allocation)"
392846113,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T08:17:09Z,only need to be multiple (different in each dimension) of max-allocatable texture size (which itself needs to be pot and square)
392872752,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:11:12Z,"this will always happen, the texture will always have a mip-tail < pagesize unless its clipped, easy to figure out `any((_img->getmipsize(_subres.basemiplevel+_subres.levelcount-1u) < m_pgszxy_as_vectorsimdu) & mask1100)`"
392873520,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:12:32Z,it doesn't get allocated in a different place in vt atlas
392873910,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:13:11Z,no need for `layer` in the name (since every layer will have the same size)
392883219,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:30:06Z,wrong the offsets into the padded physical texture are stored at the pixels of the page table
392884987,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:33:17Z,"the virtual address range can have a completely independent number of layers, and also there's no reason to have more than 1 (because even a 16kx16k texture will give you crazy virtual texcoord range)"
392889528,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:41:16Z,"`core::findmsb(core::min(_tilesperdim,(core::rounduptopot(maxallocatabletexturesize)+m_pgszxy-1u)/m_pgszxy)))+1`"
392890259,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:42:31Z,uze a proper sizeof() instead of an integer literal
392890365,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T09:42:41Z,again
392941547,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T11:07:02Z,"yeah this is screwed, cause `stexoffset` is not supposed to store that"
392970622,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:08:36Z,"now page table and physical addr texture both have the same number of pages (texels in case of page tab) and layers, so stexoffset can represent both things. however ofc u're right that numbers of pages in physical addr tex and in page table could be completely independent"
392971829,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T12:10:54Z,arent you supposed to compute that while taking the padding into account? like in `physaddrtexlayersz` or `pagecoords` ?
392973162,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:13:45Z,"nah, it's `src_` (i.e. into image being packed) offset, there's no padding"
392975190,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:17:44Z,so now i use stexoffset to represent page-wise address/offset into physical addr tex (what is stored in page table texels) and texel-wise offset into page table (then upper 16 bits are unused ofc)
392978554,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:23:26Z,"well, i think it has to be pot for allocation of squares with morton codes to work fine"
392980223,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T12:25:34Z,"yeah thats the wrong thing going into the page table, i think i'll stop reviewing the commit here."
392980874,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T12:26:22Z,"again, `stexoffset` is not your page pointer (doesn't hold the mip-tail pointer in high bits)."
392984478,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:30:48Z,thats why theres this `if ` :p
392985026,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:31:27Z,? i dont understand
392986032,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:32:35Z,what does it have to do with this code?
392990301,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:37:36Z,"you probably shouldnt even review this commit, look at state of code from last commit"
392990986,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T12:38:29Z,why are you telling me what my code is and what isnt xd
393032945,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T13:46:16Z,you don't need this variable anymore it seems?
393033495,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T13:47:10Z,"don't do that, its confusing. separate types."
393034286,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T13:48:24Z,"yea, thx"
393040001,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T13:56:54Z,"its useful to have a full 32bit virtual texture offset, because then youre megatexture can be `2^(31 + pagesizelog2*pagedimensions)` texels in size which becomes really fun once streaming is implemented (page size of 1024 could allow a 64m x 32m texture which would be enough to store the whole of the earth with resolution of 0.25m by 0.25m pixels)"
393041946,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T13:59:41Z,"ah shit you're kind of right for morton code it needs to be either `xdim(1<<tilesperdimlog2), ydim(1<<tilesperdimlog2)` or `xdim(1<<(tilesperdimlog2+1)), ydim(1<<tilesperdimlog2)`"
393042611,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:00:43Z,i don't think that `levelcount` if and logic behind calculating it works out the same.
393043046,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:01:26Z,the last page for the mip-tail it does not need a separate offset in the virtual address space
393044535,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:03:31Z,"the fact that you were using `stexoffset` as the input to this function and i'm under the impression that `stexoffset` is what you get back from the `alloc(icpuimage,subresource)` function when you ask the packer to place an image and its mipmap chain in the virtual address space"
393044795,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:03:54Z,"ah ok, didn't notice it was `src`"
393052614,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T14:14:47Z,it's not even square
393055082,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T14:17:05Z,"ah, so it's just the confusion from me using stexoffset for both things"
393074188,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:38:53Z,still need one
393076884,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:42:34Z,yes morton codes work with textures that have an aspect ratio of 1:1 or 2:1
393077538,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:43:28Z,"because its z-order and the z covers the x first so its possible to have a 2:1 ratio domain. in 3d morton code works with 2:1:1, 2:2:1 and 1:1:1"
393077783,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T14:43:47Z,looks like it
393089903,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:00:31Z,check for failed allocation
393090543,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:01:25Z,why use a loop to determine `levelcount` ?
393094620,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:07:03Z,"if `i+m_pgszxylog2+1>=_subres.levelcount` then allocate two pages instead of one (obviously make sure you quit the 3 loops as soon as possible, so you don't hit this multiple times)"
393099694,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:14:32Z,"also its more efficient to allocate addresses from the pool up to 1000 thousand at a time (stack for temporary address storage and function input arguments) using `core::address_allocator_traits ::multi_alloc(m_pageallocator,...)`"
393100483,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:15:39Z,why are you now returning a 128bit value instead of a 32bit?
393101734,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:17:29Z,dont call it `stexoffset` if this is your pointer to the physical storage page a name textureoffset is only allowed to name the offset into virtual address space
393102763,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:18:56Z,"you can't use 0 to be the ""no mip tail value"" because the valid range of page addresses is [0,max) only values past the max are allowed to be used to denote ""invalid"""
393103104,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-16T15:19:25Z,`(_offset.addr&(0xffffu<<16))!=invalid_addr`
393133767,424,Crisspl,2020-03-16T16:02:02Z,"because why not, bitdepth doesnt matter as long as its sufficient for all values"
394636034,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T20:59:03Z,something really inconsistent is going on with your use of `_subsquaresz` across alloc and free
394636972,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:00:50Z,if you're going down the virtual function route in `itexturepacker` then the type for `alloc` and `free` needs to be `iimage` not `icpuimage`
394637700,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:02:16Z,you can share all this between `icputexturepacker` and a future `igputexturepacker` by declaring it all in `itexturepacker`
394639611,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:06:11Z,lets not use constant literals unless they are blatantly obvious
394640172,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:07:26Z,i thought there as a simple equation for getting this without having to resort to a trial&error loop
394640581,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:08:15Z,this function is different for 2d and 3d i'd suppose

394652299,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:33:19Z,ok latest version looks good.
394655105,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-18T21:39:46Z,"nice stuff, really like the new api of this commit one suggestion... make the `width` and `height` store a unorm 16 unsigned ratio of `originaltexturesize/maxallocatabletexturesize` then we can easily work out the scaling factor for uvs in the virtual texture `pgtab_x` and y should be unorm offsets in virtual uv space, they will be 100% accurate as you require each dimension of virtual page table to be a power of two"

394692729,424,Crisspl,2020-03-18T23:17:53Z,i dont understand
394693356,424,Crisspl,2020-03-18T23:19:56Z,"ah, thats how u do multi_alloc"
394693666,424,Crisspl,2020-03-18T23:21:00Z,"it is, thats why `if constexpr`s are there"
394860979,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T08:31:52Z,one place uses the `_subsquaresz` as normal and `free` squares it instead? also see my comment about this class not being a proper address allocator because it doesn't conform to the api
394866289,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T08:42:37Z,"you're not getting me, you're assuming that if i do a 2d morton code with a return type `uint32_t` i want a 16bit x,y resolution but i could want a 32bit value, while only wanting a 4bit x,y resolution (morton code for values up to 255) - that stuff is useful for computing small neighbourhoods, etc. this is why the bit-depth of the morton code should not be inferred from the size of the return type."
394866751,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T08:43:25Z,"its convoluted and not pretty to work out the `levelcount`, unlike `any((_img->getmipsize(_subres.basemiplevel+_subres.levelcount-1u) < m_pgszxy_as_vectorsimdu) & mask1100)`"
394905713,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T09:52:34Z,"yes, you shouldn't be touching an `address_allocator` directly (just like std c++ lib doesn't touch allocators directly) but call all their methods via the `traits` wrapper xd"
394907553,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T09:55:29Z,yeah just make it explicit in the name that this is a `2d` function
394930664,424,Crisspl,2020-03-19T10:35:41Z,"i know it isnt, therefore i dont know why would i want to inherit from general purpose addr allocator instead of having it as member?"
394955025,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T11:21:25Z,"i'm questioning two things: 1. are you sure that is not a bug? 2. why do you need a class that looks like an address allocator, has methods almost like one and then needlessly wraps an existing address allocator?"
394980211,424,Crisspl,2020-03-19T12:11:40Z,"1. both squares it, maybe u're looking at some old code 2. maybe u're right.. i'll try to rewrite it with inheritance"
394981674,424,Crisspl,2020-03-19T12:14:21Z,"ah, ok, now i get what u mean"
394988317,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-19T12:27:15Z,"i think there's probably no need to have it in the first place, since its a very thin intermediatory to `generalpurpose`"

399548852,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T21:34:40Z,because of ieee754 precision issues once you start having virtual uv coordinates for textures that are > 32k in size (256 pages) we should support layered page tables and uv offsets

399576547,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T23:06:23Z,actually best if it goes into the global metadata that will be returned after the assets load.
399577358,424,Crisspl,2020-03-27T23:09:50Z,yea see the comment in top line. it disables set3 as an extra because they're not needed
399577868,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T23:12:01Z,ah ok
399578004,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T23:12:43Z,well you can still easily encode addresses if each dimension is pot but all are not the same
399580175,424,Crisspl,2020-03-27T23:21:52Z,vt textures (both) are getting returned as ds0 through pipeline metadata attached to every pipeline
399582051,424,Crisspl,2020-03-27T23:29:50Z,sometimes im accessing `bsdf` table through random union member (e.g. coating) because i'd to have lots of ifs just to access it through proper union member even though it's always same array (since it's a union and `bsdf` array is at the same offset in all bsdf structs). well.. this explanation is also kinda blurry xd maybe you'll want to ask on discord
399585204,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T23:44:51Z,"can you add another union as an alias, and use that instead so we're not confused to high shit?"

431093829,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T12:54:03Z,why? what's wrong with the implementation of `core::floatbitstouint` ?
431096538,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T12:58:14Z,"couple pointers: - start with implementing sampling for lambertian, then progress onto the delta distributions - `*cos_gen_sample` should take the viewsurfaceinteraction as an `in` parameter (we need to know view, normal, ndotv and possibly later the ray derivatives or ray covaraiance matrices) - do an overload for `*cos_gen_sample` that takes `vec2` and `uvec2` then we can implement, this is wo we can implement like this [code block]"
431141481,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T13:43:51Z,"since `irr_glsl_viewsurfaceinteraction` does not contain normalized `v` nor `n` we should introduce a `irr_glsl_normalizedviewsurfaceinteraction` which contains a normalized `v`, `n` and replace a few functions (`bsdf_cos_sample`, `irr_glsl_calcbsdfisotropicparams` etc. as well as change the type inside the `irr_glsl_bsdfisotropicparams` struct) that take `irr_glsl_viewsurfaceinteraction` with ones that take `irr_glsl_normalizedviewsurfaceinteraction` instead."
431220623,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T15:15:16Z,make a note that [a link] + [a link] has a sampling according to visible microfacets which is much shorter and simpler its a bit disgusting for implementation in glsl
431221320,424,Crisspl,2020-05-27T15:16:12Z,not with `floatbitstouint` but as you were saying once it's better to keep all as uints because `-ffast-math` might change some bits while copying or something (if the bits happen to match ieee754 nan or inf bit pattern)
431223459,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T15:19:11Z,hmm we could call `irr_glsl_normalizedviewsurfaceinteraction` as `irr_glsl_isotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` instead
431232866,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T15:29:12Z,"you need the frisvad tangent space creation function from example 22 (raytracedao, it might have been removed since then, but in one of the revisions it was there) this will allow you to transform out the half vector into whatever space `v` and `n` are i suggest adding a struct `irr_glsl_anisotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` to hold normalized `t`, `b`,`tdotv` and `bdotv` then this starts being relevant. we can have two overloads of `irr_glsl_calcanisotropicinteraction(in irr_glsl_isotropicviewsurfaceinteraction isotropic, args...)` : - one where `args` are `in vec3 t, in vec3 b` (user knows and cares about tangent space, require t and b be normalized inputs) - one where `args` is just `in vec3 t`, its the same as above but you construct bitangent from `cross(n,t)` - one where `args` are nothing and you use frisvad method to construct tangent space quickly then using t,b,n it will be really easy for you to bring the h vector to the space of `v`"

431276556,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:26:12Z,if ax==ay then ax*ay ==a2 now the problem is that i don't remember is anistropy is a ratio of ax/ay or ay/ax could we worked out from the `irr_glsl_ggx_burley_aniso` above
431277005,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:26:55Z,use frisvad function
431279066,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:30:03Z,"probably because stratified sampling preserves area, and area is proportional to radius squared so if you want to map a linear change in area to a change in radius you need to sqrt the area (first random number == sub-circle area)"

431286751,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:40:25Z,that `sincos` function would be useful here

431289604,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:45:04Z,hmm probably not in this case.
431296284,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:54:09Z,"also need to handle a special case when length of stretched vector is close to zero (smooth surface and grazing angle), or this whole thing will be full of `nan` (when `ndotv` is close to zero, we have a tendency of `a--->1.0`, etc.) meaning you can just skip the whole body and set `tdoth=0.0;bdoth=0.0;ndoth=1.0;`"
431298583,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:57:00Z,"there's no need for that `max`, sqrt from before guarantees non negativity, t2 is zero in z by construction, t1 and v should be positive also your `n` here is equivalent to `tdoth,bdoth,ndoth`"
431300322,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T16:59:32Z,"iee754 should guarantee that `p1` and `p2` computed above are always `<=1.0`, which in turn should guarantee that their squares are smaller.... not sure about whether the `- p1*p1 - p2*p2>-1.0`, but we should probably try it without the `max` clamp at some point when you're finished"
431302187,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T17:02:37Z,"actually you should keep track of the sign of `ndotv` because you should use a temporary var equal to `abs(ndotv)`, then do the whole sampling"
431306168,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T17:09:30Z,you could store the `u.y<a` [code block]

431317461,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T17:28:42Z,"actually the part onwards from when you establish `tdoth`,`bdoth` and `ndoth` could be a helper function shared amongst all specular sampling routines since the rest of the math is always the same"
431485665,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-27T22:48:10Z,"afaik when preforming assignment/copy everything should be fine, its just performing any other operation with them might backfire"

431755389,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-28T11:05:59Z,"well yeah, because `irr_glsl_isotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` would indicate that the user does not know the tangent vector (has not provided one) and we can make one up using the frisvad function, and `irr_glsl_anisotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` represents a known tangent frame where user specified `t` (and even `b`) explicitly (you cannot rotate it for them)."
431757124,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-28T11:09:29Z,"i'm not against requiring bsdf sampling functions take `irr_glsl_anisotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` as input always, i just want 3 or more different ways of turning a `irr_glsl_isotropicviewsurfaceinteraction` into the anisotropic struct."
431813985,424,Crisspl,2020-05-28T12:57:29Z,"yea, because without sqrt samples much more dence near to centre of disk, same thing as uniform disk sampling described in pbrt (not the concentric one)"

432710828,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:07:39Z,i thought we agreed to have the light and bsdf sampling instruction streams separate and with different opcodes?
432712128,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:10:42Z,"you should really put the `scale` into the same byte offset on these bsdf data structs, so that you may fetch outside the if statements"
432712664,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:11:57Z,also the multiplication of the `a` by `scale` should be carried out near the `return` outside the if statements
432713080,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:12:55Z,work out `instr_getalphautexpresence(instr)` before you enter the if (which could be changed to a switch with a `#define` or something so we can benchmark later)
432713500,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:13:52Z,actually this whole line [code block] could be done outside the divergent flow control
432724374,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:40:07Z,actually i'll just go ahead and suggest the optimized version [code block] should be muuuch faster
432726620,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:45:21Z,"there's no diffuse in a dielectric, this is a delta distribution and its impossible to sample explicitly (this opcode should be gone anyway)"

432728288,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:49:22Z,maybe move the `a2` to the cpu side (run an image filter to square the roughness values)

432730801,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T20:55:40Z,speculatively compute `ndoth2` before you diverge

432735221,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T21:06:11Z,"i'd move this `if (currbsdfparams.isotropic.ndotl>flt_min)` outside the divergence and all the way to the `else` of `twosided` in the calling function, this way we can skip the entire intruction executing function for anything that is not roughdielectric or difftrans"
432735339,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T21:06:29Z,"this would simplify your life, because for transmissive materials (pretty much only roughdielectric and difftrans) you need to account for `ndotv<0` and `ndotl<0`"
432737235,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T21:10:57Z,"basically pair it with a `isbrdf` function (brdf cannot be lit or viewed from the back, unless ofc `twosided`, but then you can only light it from the side you can view it, a.k.a. ndotv and ndotl need to be `abs()`>flt_min have the same sign, plus `ndotv>flt_min || twosided`)"
432737836,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T21:12:33Z,i also notice that most bsdf (brdf included) instructions need to fetch at least two textures (one roughness and other some parameter) and every texture has an associated scale... maybe we should fetch the textures without divergence?
432738218,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-29T21:13:30Z,this needs to go to a special constants or numerics/limits header

509381080,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:22:06Z,why are you screwing around with the microfacet cache here?
509381340,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:22:26Z,what are you doing with the microfacet cache here?
509382890,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:24:29Z,no idea why this function exists
509383981,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:25:47Z,ok i get it now.
509384976,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:27:01Z,why would zeros be a problem? also `tdoth` and `bdoth` should be equal to 0.0 ! you got everything the wrong way round xd
509386704,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:29:14Z,`ndoth = 1.0`
509391195,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:35:05Z,why did you set pdf to 1.0 ? it should be infinite!
509391838,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:35:55Z,you should use the special switch/if macro here
509399401,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:45:42Z,"this is wrong, the `remainder` shouldn't be multiplied by the weight. `pdf` can be multiplied by `weight` or you could not track weight at all and use `rcpchoiceprob` directly"
509399807,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:46:15Z,you could initialize `out_pdf` to 1.0 instead and use `rcpchoiceprob` later on
509400689,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:47:24Z,"you could just divide `out_pdf` by `rcpchoiceprob` or multiply it here instead of `weight`, as long as `out_pdf` was initialized to 1.0"

509407187,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:55:58Z,"this is weird, it should just be [code block]"
509408551,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T15:57:47Z,you could just assign straight to `out_remainder` and `out_uf`

509414106,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:05:29Z,use `irr_glsl_partitionrandvariable` instead you need to just divide the `out_pdf` by the `rcpchoiceprob` and multiply the future `out_rem` by `rcpchoiceprob` **this is the only exception to not multiplying the `out_rem` by the pdf of generator choice (because the probability here will not match a `vec3` fresnel exactly)**
509415378,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:07:16Z,lets do it.
509415708,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:07:44Z,its the backend that should be propagating the twosided thing down the ast branches
509415905,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:08:02Z,what does mitsuba say?
509416270,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:08:34Z,ok
509416356,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:08:42Z,which node?
509416472,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:08:53Z,comment it out for now.
509416831,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:09:21Z,i dont get the explanation
509417049,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:09:41Z,dont have an unused variable handing around
509418175,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:11:18Z,this whole function's existence doesnt make sense really
509418925,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:12:22Z,this function's existence probably doesn't make sense either
509427322,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:24:41Z,also you have a bug because `u.z` does not get paritioned/rescaled
509435564,424,Crisspl,2020-10-21T16:36:48Z,mixture -> blends translation
509445110,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:51:08Z,"there's a far easier way to deal with the generator, it will be less divergent, less code and easier to read & understand. you should tear into the microfacet transmission generators to see how it all comes together. it's best if you intialized `out_rem` to 1.0 for non plastics and then multiplied factors onto it. ### first of all handle your reflective fresnel if your bsdf is not diffuse (diffuse or difftrans) then you will need to treat it somewhat like a blend node. the way you choose plastic vs. diffuse right now is 100% ok except for variable partition/rescale that is missing. you need an extra flag besides `out_generatorinstr` to discern which sub-generator was used. if you choose the diffuse generator, then you need to premultiply or initialize the `out_rem` to the fresnel diffuse correction factor **multiplied by `rcpchoiceprob`**, then proceed to the diffuse generator path. however for the specular generator, then you need to premultiply or initialize the `out_rem` to be the `rcpchoiceprob`, you'd then need to proceed as for a conductor, except that you **compute the fresnel like for a dielectric.** ## all non-diffuse bsdf generators generate a half vector h first so you should split your code for generating an `s` into two branches, diffuse vs. non-diffuse. ### diffuse path doesn't matter if its diff or difftrans, you need to generate a point on a hemisphere. if the material is difftrans then you use the `u.z` variable to flip the `l` direction with 50% probability pdf is trivial to compute. the microfacet cache, you should compute using our built-in function that takes an interaction and a light sample (specialized for the reflective case). ### the specular path use the correct generator to generate `h` given your ndf, it doesn't matter if the material is conductor or dielectric. if the material is smooth then simply set `h=n` (but this backend has no smooth materials, it just has ndfs with 0 roughness, so this point is moot). now for the `out_rem` compute the g2/g1 function (there might be some useful metadate that a generator overload might return). to compute the pdf you need to multiply it by ndf*g1 initially, there's one extra step in case of a dielectric material. compute the fresnel of `vdoth`, but dont use it yet. if the material cannot be refractive then set a `refraction` boolean to false. otherwise if the material could be refractive (dielectric) then choose between reflection and refraction based on the previously calculated fresnel's luma coefficients, divide the `out_rem` and multiply the pdf by the probability of your choice respectively. multiply `out_rem` by the correct frensel depending on `refraction` boolean (either `f` or `1-f`) now there's a handy function in our glsl library which can construct a microfacet cache given a view interaction, a microfacet `h` vector, a refraction boolean a few extra infos like the refractive index. use it. that's it, you're done!"
509447295,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:54:22Z,what's all this doing here?
509447508,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:54:40Z,i have these already?
509448951,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:56:36Z,same as [a link] but this time also about tdotl and bdotl
509449534,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:57:26Z,you could roll this into one if-statement

509450536,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T16:58:49Z,"you also don't need the `ts_flag` to make sure you don't flip twice, because `currinteraction.isotropic.ndotv<0.0` ensures you won't p.s. this also means you dont need any special handling for the bumpmap case"
509456818,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T17:08:40Z,"however because ""two sided"" was only supposed to be applied to some bsdf nodes, you need to keep track of whether the directions were flipped, so i propose this [code block] 100% guaranteed to work."

509679866,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T20:43:30Z,"this is messed up... it increases divergence in a clandestine way there's a loop of a variable number of prefetch instructions, each of which can have a variable number of texture fetches (0-4). why can't we preprocess this off-line and unroll the current prefetch instrction + bsdf_data texture handles into a simple texture prefetch stream where each instruction will prefetch only one texture/constant and write to only one set of registers? also doing this offline on cpu (preparing the list), would allow us to thin out the bsdf data (remove all textures and constants that would be prefetched)"
509680684,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T20:44:28Z,a prefetch instruction would need to be a `uvec4` instead of a `uvec2`

509711879,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-21T21:25:30Z,instead of `irr_glsl_mc_getcampos` we should require `irr_glsl_mc_getnormalizedworldspacev()`

512176955,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T18:24:04Z,i also take issue with the fact that direct childre of this `fresnel` combiner node are `cmicrofacetspecularbsdfnode` which when used directly are supposed to handle their own fresnel?
513400368,424,Crisspl,2020-10-28T12:24:32Z,"right, this comment is useless. it will wrok fine if user provides custom loader override. resolved"
513594751,424,Crisspl,2020-10-28T16:39:12Z,"anyway.. when dielectric gets its dedicated ir node, it will not be used by anything in mitsuba frontend. but it is present in mdl under the name `df::fresnel_layer`. see [a link] `et_weight_blend` is however used for encoding mitsuba's `blendbsdf`"

514551555,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-29T20:38:13Z,what happened to this?
514552057,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-29T20:39:10Z,actually because this function you execute when this brdf was not the generator... the pdf should be 0.0

514554809,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-29T20:44:04Z,i think its related to this [a link] which is basically why do you need a special root node type anyway?
514555129,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-29T20:44:34Z,"which is only the rest of the branch from thin onwards should be thin, not the whole ast"
514558166,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-29T20:50:26Z,"twosided in mitsuba means it has the same bsdf on both sides... just saying. also if you allow this then you need a ""fixed"" front&back separate root node (two separate asts), not at literally every single node on the way down makes for a cleaner implementation, two separate instruction streams and stuff for front and back (but could be identical as in the case of mitsuba) then in glsl or whatever you can do `instructionstream[gl_frontface ? frontoffset:backoffset]` instead of turning our ir into an abomination also get rid of dedicated root node type, i dont see a point of having it"

518709635,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:05:31Z,there's no reason why you should be using `cos_eval_dg` because you can handle beckmann + ggx and anisotropy in a way that reduces divergence... at the very least you should be using `wo_clamps` functions
518710388,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:07:07Z,why is it a reflect now?
518710575,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:07:31Z,this needs to be the other way round if you're constructing the ir ast for the backface
518712807,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:12:23Z,lets talk about consistency. either we differentiate between rough and smooth (microfacet and delta) or we dont and allow 0 roughness materials. so either you have delta_specular + microfacet_specular delta_coating + microfacet_coating delta_dielectric + microfacet_dielectric delta_thin_dielectric + microfacet_thin_dielectric where a microfacet_thin_dielectric is a todo (backends assert that its not used) or just microfacet_specular microfacet_coating microfacet_dielectric microfacet_thin_dielectric where a rough thindielectric is a todo (backends assert that roughness is 0)
518713790,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:14:34Z,"ah ok, its the world space pos of the frament... i misread and thought it was the camera."
518715778,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:18:55Z,i'm sure i already had a function like this... what are you trying to achieve or use this for?
518716857,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:21:03Z,proper way to do it (putting asside the do we put weight on pdf issue) [code block] always use the `rcpprob` from the partition function!
518720558,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:28:46Z,wtf?
518724498,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T12:37:12Z,lol xd thx
518727988,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:44:26Z,decided
518729126,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:46:43Z,"oh, btw you need a `delta_transmission` (to implement opacity mask)"
518729807,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:48:13Z,"the sample will always be valid for the generator, no need to check here... its only when you evaluate (or get remainder from non-generators)!"
518730267,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:49:07Z,the generator will always generate valid samples for itself.
518730806,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:50:12Z,"nope... you're supposed to check if samples are valid inside `irr_bsdf_cos_generate` for each bsdf, separately"
518732885,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T12:54:35Z,"pdf of a delta bsdf as a generator is infinite, as a evaluator its 0 (the probability density around the only value you can generate is infinite, but if the exact generator isnt used then its impossible to obtain the exact value)."
518770648,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T14:03:29Z,"this is an awful if statement anyway... will be deleted, resolved"
518796097,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T14:44:49Z,"yep, im aware, just not the time yet"
518799597,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T14:50:11Z,so.. what went down here?
518800410,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T14:51:25Z,"should be unneeded if you use the same func to compute the microfacet case for diffuse, difftrans and thindielectric (only in the reflective case obvs)"
518822222,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T15:23:31Z,"there's no r32g32_sfloat anymore, but vt obvs need extra features as we established (will be done in separate pr on my fork)"
518830191,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T15:35:50Z,because the estimator (overall remainder) is `rem = sum{0...n}(w_i*f_i)/sum{0...n}(w_i*p_i);` you can split it w.r.t. the generator `g` `rem = (w_g*f_g+sum{i!=g}(w_i*f_i))/sum{0...n}(w_i*p_i);` divide both sides by `w_g*p_g` `rem = (w_g*f_g/(w_g*p_g)+sum{i!=g}(w_i*f_i)/(w_g*p_g))/(sum{i!=g}(w_i*p_i)/(w_g*p_g)+1.0);` and it just so happens that `w_g*f_g/(w_g*p_g)` is the unweighted remainder of the generator bxdf `f_g/p_g`
518834572,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T15:42:39Z,something went wrong during the merge
518838529,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T15:48:57Z,"i didnt merge your branch, just mine"
518844910,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T15:58:56Z,actually you could change the name of `is_valid` to `can_eval` and here you could do `can_eval = cosfactor>flt_min;`
518845428,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T15:59:43Z,see [a link] you could use `can_eval` here
518845789,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T16:00:20Z,could merge this if/else with the previous
518852724,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T16:11:49Z,why recompute from scratch? if the view and light positions don't change then your half vector doesnt change and its dot product with v or l don't either
518853630,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T16:13:22Z,i fail to see any weighting of the eval and pdf?
518859084,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T16:22:26Z,btw there's two forms of getting the remainder `generator_rem/(1.0+restpdf/generator_pdf) + acc/pdf` and `(generator_rem+acc/generator_pdf)/(1.0+restpdf/generator_pdf)` where `generator_rem` is the unweighted remainder of the generator
518921779,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T18:13:39Z,remove comment.
518923589,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T18:17:01Z,you sure that's right?
518926830,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T18:23:15Z,what is this `w` and `out_weight` used for?
518927721,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T18:24:55Z,"ok its wrong, you cant use the actual weights as the pdf weights, because that works differently"
518933305,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T18:35:55Z,because it's done in instr_execute_eval_pdf_coating/blend if thats what you mean
518933781,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T18:36:55Z,best i could come up with without knowing h and l
518934550,424,Crisspl,2020-11-06T18:38:17Z,out_weight goes to `instr_execute_cos_eval_pdf_coating` to not compute same thing twice
518935068,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T18:39:23Z,"because your generator chooses coat with probability `fresnel(ndotv)` the pdf should be `mix(coated_pdf,coat_pdf,fresnel(ndotv))`, so `out_weight=1.0-fresnel(ndotv)` (i'd rather have you swap l/r child nodes around with coat with coated so you don't need to do `1.0-` all the time)"
518963227,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T19:37:11Z,ok
518963411,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-06T19:37:38Z,"ah ok, merge mine at some point"
522309737,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-12T18:05:30Z,so the base was made?
523135529,424,Crisspl,2020-11-13T18:12:48Z,im sure
523138030,424,Crisspl,2020-11-13T18:17:07Z,"i think i can get rid of this scattering mode actually `reflect` is set without a reason, it's ignored by glsl backend anyway"
523138567,424,Crisspl,2020-11-13T18:17:45Z,thats how it's done ;)
523141954,424,Crisspl,2020-11-13T18:21:23Z,"not used any more in material compiler, but i think it can be left in the glsl header as is?"
524263065,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:22:31Z,"you no longer need to flip, if you're doing twosided as separate instruction streams, so this function needs not to exist"
526478109,424,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-18T22:55:14Z,"my god... how could nvidia produce such a royal fuckup! weighing the coated bxdf by the top level bsdf's microfacet fresnel :person_facepalming: we should probably emit warnings in the future when encountering the use of `df::fresnel_layer` in blend materials telling people nvidia fucked up big time. we should not support that abomination... if something is getting weighted by fresnel, only the left bsdf gets weighted by microfacet fresnel, the right one will be weighted by the 2 fresnels we usually use for diffuse. we will correct it, if someone wants the broken behaviour (and consistency with other tools that loose energy) they can patch the engine."

362095494,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T21:02:21Z,"actually we should go the **ubershader** route here, which is one shader with all the material models, where you only switch between them using a uniform or a push constant (whichever one you like). the metadata returned will help the user build the ""expected"" descriptor set contents."
362095859,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T21:04:11Z,cool but you need to add one more binding for a per-material ubo (for materials parameters)

362122948,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T23:49:49Z,"the idea should be that your loader for mtl (and to be honest any other loader, except for .baw) adds big ubershaders to the asset manager in the constructor of the loader (when it gets added). then we only really compile once when loading the models of a particular format, and no have to deal with ""fake"" shader swaps on the api side. you should cache your pipeline layouts too, since you'll probably be returning the same one over and over again (unless you choose to differentiate for different texture set-ups)."
362123335,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T23:53:17Z,"in reality the pipelines themselves could also be precomputed and during the load, cloned appropriately (they only need to be unique objects because the metadata changes, but internals will be identical) it will be important to implement a correct `operator==` for `core::unordered_set` for pipelines, shaders and layouts that can reduce duplicates in the default cpu to gpu object converter."
362123589,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T23:55:20Z,kill the usage of `core::vector3df` and `core::vector2df` while you're at it.

362125492,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-31T00:12:54Z,shouldn't you be using the variant where you can specify the hierarchy level ? you're loading from a dependent loader also: [a link]

362127230,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-31T00:29:19Z,obvs don't touch the loaders and cpu images ;)
362127275,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-31T00:29:53Z,imageview cpu2gpu will also need the `levelcount` patch-up

362598781,410,Crisspl,2020-01-02T19:30:35Z,"well, i think only `ambient` and `shininess` is of no use for pbr. fun fact: all of these summed up is exactly 128 bytes"

362604946,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-02T19:47:25Z,ok but that controls smoothing etc. afaik
362607634,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-02T19:55:12Z,"hmm.. i think i got confused, although i believe i could have been thinking about the need of the normals to be flipped for rh meshes (different winding order for front-face so different cross product sign needed)"
362610072,410,Crisspl,2020-01-02T20:02:07Z,"there is some `s` aka smooth group thing in obj spec, but not used/supported in our loader"
362617097,410,Crisspl,2020-01-02T20:24:46Z,i see that `irr/builtin/samplers/default` has `anisotropicfilter = 4u`. should it also be like it in those?
362651501,410,Crisspl,2020-01-02T22:19:00Z,"nah, it always assumed triangles. i dont why there was reserve(32) then so i changed it to 3"

366373299,410,AnastaZIuk,2020-01-14T14:37:07Z,wasn't it like that at beginning?
366393982,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T15:11:56Z,is this clear?

366473316,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T17:29:07Z,agreed
366473766,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T17:30:06Z,dont call it gpu mesh

366489875,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:04:00Z,i think you lost `m_containsglsl` here...
366490383,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:05:17Z,maybe define these in terms of `icpumeshbuffer::pipeline_hierarchylevels_below+1u` etc. ?
366491010,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:06:41Z,copy the `isdummyobjectforcachealiasing` field or place an `assert(isdummyobjectforcachealiasing)`
366491251,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:07:16Z,explain why are we changing this?
366492932,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:10:56Z,make sure it won't throw (that you still have 8 characters in the string left).
366493133,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:11:19Z,same here about the throw
366502167,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:30:50Z,"ok, i remember [a link] is that the reason?"
366503019,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T18:32:34Z,ok i see the new change now.
366517802,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:03:16Z,"well if the shader requires stuff that is ""constant"" (not world matrix) like stuff that you'd have to fill from the metadata to make the material ""work"", like illumination model, ambient and diffuse, etc. then you should sure create, attach and fill an ubo or fill a push constant with data."
366532991,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:35:25Z,use `descriptor_set` and `descriptor_set_layout` instead of `ds` and `ds_layout` in the paths (let it be verbose). and please for the love of god give it a different name than `default_ds1` !
366533643,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:36:44Z,`basic_view_parameters` or something.
366533877,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:37:20Z,"actually make a struct with proper packing, padding and alignment that people could then use to fill out data for the shader, and take the `sizeof` that"
366534214,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:38:00Z,alos mv/m and 3x3 normal matrices are 12 bytes (same as `core::matrix3x4simd`) not 16
366535315,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:40:19Z,"also because a `mat3` takes the space of a `mat4x3` you can stash the `vec3` camera position in the unused column of a `mat3/mat4x3` when in `row_major` layout (fun fact, you can get it directly in glsl without transpose because glsl works on columns)"
366535694,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:41:06Z,"you're going to need this line a lot, make a lambda or something to fill icpubuffer with dead beef."
366538697,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:47:34Z,"well 16x anisotropic filter (2^4) is the max on most economy-grade gpus, so yes."
366538848,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T19:47:57Z,unless you're making a `irr/builtin/samplers/nearest` xd
366545289,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:02:19Z,"i see the following pairing (not gospel, approximate) so i guess if you're not switching shaders when you're switching textures, it can do in set 3."
366545607,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:03:04Z,"it should be though, i think."
366555685,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:26:57Z,"this gets split in two, the ubo declaration, and the data struct. data struct goes to: - glsl a common include that's builtin - a matching c++ `struct` with correct alignment in some aptly named directory and header inside `irr/asset/` likewise for the ubo declaration"
366556043,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:27:49Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `vertex_inputs`
366556216,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:28:13Z,like we talked on discord (there's a few examples with correct syntax)
366562837,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:43:59Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `vertex_outputs`
366562937,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:44:14Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard as well
366563297,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:45:07Z,`normalize` goes around `vnormal` not the whole matrix thing
366563650,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:45:59Z,"`matrix*vec4(v,1.0)` needs its own function and header (`vertex_utils.glsl` or something)"
366565460,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:50:27Z,the proper way to factor it out is `matrix[0]*v.x+matrix[1]*v.y+matrix[2]*v.z+matrix[3]`
366566371,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:52:33Z,wrap the main in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `vertex_main`
366567417,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:54:57Z,furthermore the `camdata` built-in header should have a function that does the mvp and mv transformations on some input vector (and uses the `vertex_utils.glsl`)
366568211,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:56:54Z,factor out into a struct and a built-in header (`irr/builtin/glsl/graphicspipeline/loaders/mtl/common.glsl`)
366568356,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:57:17Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `fragment_input_pushconstants`

366568609,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:57:58Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `fragment_output_framebuffer`
366569093,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:59:09Z,just handle everything in a `switch` gpu branching still costs a little bit.
366569322,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T20:59:43Z,wrap this in a `#ifndef + #define` guard for `fragment_main`
366570408,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T21:02:07Z,"different path is needed, `irr/builtin/shader/loaders/obj/...`"
366575003,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T21:13:29Z,"all these shaders should be simple overrides of the uv version (or vice versa), thats why i want you to wrap every blok in `#ifndef + #define` guards with separated declarations and definitions so simple changes like this are possible without duplicate code."
366575208,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T21:13:59Z,actually make the non-uv version be the override of the uv version
366894417,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:10:20Z,"you don't return ds1, you leave space for it, the pipeline metadata (this is why i made a base shared class) shall instruct the user how to construct and fill the ubos used by ds1 + layout will tell how to make ds1"
366899061,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:18:54Z,"can you factor this out to a common non-virtual inline function, otherwise the custom icpubuffers will still keep intact `size` and `isdummyobjectforcachealiasing`"
366899780,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:20:08Z,very important
366900700,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:21:46Z,maybe we should refactor this extension and have an `init` function that adds this shader to the built-ins? (or just put this vertex shader in built-in engine core)
366911400,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:40:42Z,this is all basically copied from the ex 13 brdf explorer? correct?
366917408,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:51:21Z,maybe fix it on your branch and pr
366917965,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T14:52:16Z,actually examples are here [a link]

366928537,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T15:10:59Z,why fragment shader is not added to cache yet?
366928936,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T15:11:39Z,or will it be added by mtl loader?

366939872,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T15:29:26Z,you should be getting views from the asset cache (not create new ones every single time!)!
366980824,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T16:37:28Z,shouldn't the mtl loader load the textures and create the descriptor set?
366981596,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T16:38:53Z,anyway why not create the descriptor set in the mtl loader?
366982156,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T16:39:46Z,shouldn't this be in mtl loader?
366982395,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T16:40:14Z,at least the fragment shader thing
366995161,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T17:03:18Z,"by ""this class"" u mean mtl loader or mtl metadata?"
366996958,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T17:06:48Z,i'll have to read more about what this actually is
366997630,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T17:08:09Z,"yea, i'll have to adjust cmtlassetmetadata more to what it's supposed to be according to your idea"
366998242,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T17:09:20Z,"lambda? i need this in just this one place. if you mean ""a lot"" globally, then why lambda?"
367025409,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T18:05:03Z,because frag shaders are generated dynamically (see `getshaders()`) but i think it can be static (like vs) with the knowledge that bindings in desc sets doesnt have to be continuous
367025896,410,Crisspl,2020-01-15T18:06:10Z,"i guess it could, i remember i made this decision for some reason but i cant remember.."
367033615,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:22:49Z,metadata.
367034207,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:23:58Z,"i think its basically which faces/vertices get ""artificially"" put together for normal recomputation. this is the whole reason why i wanted the normal recompute function to take a lambda to determine if edge/triangles are connected"
367036900,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:29:36Z,"lambda, or something... i can see it being used to fill many buffer with deadbeef"
367038635,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:33:18Z,"yeah bindings don't have to be continuous, you could do one descset layout for all i care, but then you need to hook up a blank 1x1 texture into the empty slots, so you only need 2 fragment shaders."
367038786,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:33:37Z,views should definitely be cached.
367040673,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T18:37:38Z,views and textures should be handled by mtl loader
367053520,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:06:02Z,"insert at the very end, multithreaded work might fuck up completely with this mutable crap, assets shouldnt be put in cache until they're in their final form."
367059044,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:18:06Z,"i wonder if there's any point in computing these rough normals, if we have the geometry manipulator function to smooth meshes."
367064324,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:29:23Z,you can slam that in the mtl
367065189,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:31:14Z,"in the mtl, don't need to check for uvs, but there's not only the opacity map, there's also the transmission map that you'd need to check for (different blend equation needed though, probably dual source blending or sth its like having a separate alpha for every rgb channel)"
367066299,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:33:35Z,"even though you clone, you should cache it in the mtl loader (so the total number of clones is limited)"
367066999,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-15T19:35:04Z,"desc set 3 should be made in mtl loader, always"
367635290,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:33:18Z,"nah, refl map takes 6 enum values but is just one map, that's why 13bits"
367636441,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:35:34Z,"`-clamp` in mtl/obj spec. if map in .mtl has -clamp flag then it needs sampler with clamp to edge (you can read mtl spec about this, it's actually not clear to me but that's what i assumed)"
367637681,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:38:11Z,"we might have to talk about it. generally it may result in assets converted to empty cache handles that arent actually cache handles and whats more you cannot make gpu objects from them any more because they've dropped needed resources. that's why i changed it to `0u`, i wasnt sure if it wasnt the cause of crashes during creation of gpu objects"
367639000,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:40:53Z,"some of them, actually it seems a little like we decided to put `=true` in iasset::converttodummyobject implementations but then forgot about it and now some of them have this and some dont"
367640098,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:43:34Z,i dont understand. what does it mean to handle multiple subsequent calls in this context?
367640384,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:44:19Z,"nah, see constructor"
367641931,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:48:04Z,"no, it's fix so that it actually compare contents (contained assets) and not just array pointers"
367643550,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T20:51:53Z,it checks sizes by itself
367686206,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T22:37:18Z,"ah i know why, because theres no way to return it"
367696793,410,Crisspl,2020-01-16T23:10:49Z,"ah, correction, i assumed it mean clamp to border with border color being `etbc_float_opaque_black`"
367925487,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T13:05:34Z,"yea, thats why im not modifying indirect draw buffer and parameter buffer state. passing nullptr as 2 last args to this functions results in setting indirect draw and parameter buffer bindings to 0 for really no reason"
368035478,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T16:51:41Z,"yes, exact copy-paste"
368036094,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T16:53:02Z,i dont get it. builtin for normalizing and dot products?
368067154,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T18:09:22Z,"i dont understand. how struct can be aligned to anything? it's just struct, not memory address"
368070750,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T18:18:12Z,? i dont understand
368071508,410,Crisspl,2020-01-17T18:20:06Z,i think i could use some simple example of what u have in mind
368120385,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-17T20:22:41Z,slam a (refcounted) pointer to it in the metadata ;)
368120992,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-17T20:24:05Z,"there's only a certain (given) max number of permutations of such a pipeline for all possible vertex inputs, blend states, and shaders attached... shouldn't be cloning a new one, if you've already made an identical one."
368121207,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-17T20:24:29Z,discussed in discord.
368122287,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-17T20:26:59Z,"yes, cause there are tricks to get them faster, and user (all implementations and shaders) should rely on the function to get all the dot products and vectors (we make an improvement, every shader benefits, instead of non-dry code)."
368122723,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-17T20:28:09Z,"ok in this case they need the `cos` factor inside them, and a cleanup of names (prefix mostly) and parameters (conform to above). as already mentioned you can leave `sample` functions as a todo."
368245455,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T19:58:01Z,"`alignas` is possible on structs and classes in c++11, it instructs the compiler that the `this` pointer will be aligned, but most importantly it will guarantee alignment on **stack** allocated objects, and within other structs... etc. its specified on vectorsimdf and matrices (by composition) ;)"
368245480,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T19:58:13Z,i see.
368245545,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T19:59:35Z,"so why is it extra metadata if the same thing can just be present in the descriptor set layout with the correct immutable sampler? (furthermore, why paths, if we can put entire descriptor set in metadata xd)"
368246860,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:28:26Z,"goes into the mtl pipeline metadata, case closed."
368246994,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:31:23Z,"hmm ok, my original algorithm assumed that no one would be so dumb as to add the same contents twice... but i guess making it more idiot-proof doesn't cost that much perf, so ok."
368247091,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:33:18Z,setting them to 0 in a `drawmesh` is the correct solution... otherwise you have state pollution! (which is exactly why we invented the whole state tracking system in the first place). imagine firing off a few indirect draws before a `drawmesh` and then getting random results from the `drawmesh` depending on which was the last indirect draw to go before it!
368247988,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:53:23Z,after i call `converttodummyobject` on any `iasset` i should be able to call `converttodummyobject` again without any side-effects.
368248021,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:54:07Z,basically i want this check inside the asset's `converttodummyobject` method as well.
368248218,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:59:16Z,"great but wrong file for all this stuff, iassetmanager or similar no idea why youre screwing around with this in the `video` namespace"
368248222,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T20:59:30Z,make it rgba8
368248276,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T21:00:50Z,"default color should be ""oczojebny"" pink/magenta with alpha 255 hell, if you want to you can make it a 2x2 checkerboard of grey and magenta to be more obvious."
368248290,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T21:01:21Z,ok but the proper struct?
368248342,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T21:02:04Z,dword all caps
368252268,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T22:30:11Z,"std::array has a `back()` method, we should have one too in `dynamic_array`"
368252390,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T22:33:01Z,why do you get rid of my `const auto&` or `auto&` so often? we should be using it as often as possible to make sure accidental copy constructions don't happen.
368252858,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T22:44:57Z,this is all fucked
368252925,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T22:46:18Z,+1 not +count
368253028,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T22:48:39Z,i should have called `prevbinding` `prevoffset` instead and it would be less misleading
368253204,410,Crisspl,2020-01-18T22:54:00Z,because its just pair of pointers and `const auto&` just holds rvalue retuned from `getbindings` because of lifetime expansion which seemed weird to me
368253474,410,Crisspl,2020-01-18T23:01:38Z,it already has
368253493,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:02:24Z,"hmm ok, but most of the time we want to use `auto&` or `const auto&` because you can't see the type easily, i thought it was one of our containers."
368253509,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:02:54Z,why not use it?
368253580,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:04:31Z,wait what!? why all attachments? you're only gonna write to the first one with this pipeline!
368253589,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:05:14Z,doesn't mtl support like way more ways to make stuff blendable? or is it only the opacity map?
368253637,410,Crisspl,2020-01-18T23:06:10Z,"idk, thats where all default assets are added and you started this :p"
368253685,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:07:31Z,"still want all this crap in a struct, furthermore, the alignment of this will be all fucked up, vec3 is aligned like a vec4, i doubt the memory layout is the same in your c++ struct (better put one of the `float`s after each `vec3`)"
368253817,410,Crisspl,2020-01-18T23:11:00Z,`bindings` is `srange` and not `dynamic_array`
368253978,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:15:22Z,still need to use the a common brdf util header to get all the vectors (that common code i linked you).
368254044,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:17:20Z,still relevant?
368254148,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:20:09Z,that should definitely be inside the implementations!
368254155,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:20:23Z,as with discord you will change to ~0u
368254235,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:22:49Z,questions?
368254366,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:25:59Z,related [a link]
368255356,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:55:08Z,"i don't think i started this, i'm not a great fan of lambdas. only thing i remember is a default up and down streaming buffer. ofc there was the 4 default materials/shaders that i've carried on from vanilla-irrlicht, but they started that (and you should nuke them, now! - replace with a default pipeline that does a textured, solid non opaque thing with no lighting). everything needs to move to iassetmanager or some more appropriate place within `irr::asset` maybe to reduce clutter we should make a `iassetmanager::createbuiltinsbeforeloaders` and `iassetmanager::createbuiltinsafterloaders` to call before and after the asset-loaders and registered and constructed."
368255515,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-18T23:59:36Z,"yes, because there's hacks that speed it all up, and you dont want to keep code dry"
368255686,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:04:31Z,still of the opinion textures (descriptor set) and fragment shader should be handled by mtl loader.
368255752,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:06:02Z,"please for the love of god don't use numerical literals as stand-ins for sizes, always `sizeof` and of the correct struct type!"
368255764,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:06:25Z,same as [a link]
368255879,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:08:32Z,"we should be doing this programmatically, not from **magical** convention knowledge that desc-set 1 is being used with this particular layout, and in that layout there is a ubo that requires that particular struct (still useful to have the struct in c++ for power-user). would be good to build it from standardised pipeline metadata."
368255902,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:09:24Z,"actually that's dangerous, shouldn't be touching parents in this chain"
368255957,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:11:01Z,make it a dummy right away
368255985,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:11:35Z,hmm actually don't
368256040,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:13:01Z,"i don't think that struct and its methods belong in ""vertex"" utilities per-se (same could be used in fragment shaders, etc)."
368256149,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T00:16:27Z,that said `ivideodriver` (or cpu to gpu asset converter) could benefit from a method called `convertallbuiltinstogpu` for memory reclaiming
368305548,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:20:43Z,still issue of why are you setting blending on all attachments!?
368305991,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:27:37Z,why always false?
368306081,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:29:25Z,why use numerical literals?
368306133,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:30:35Z,"you should be caching these, as there is only so many permutations you can generate (plus they will be cloned and patched for vertex inputs anyway)."
368306205,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:31:42Z,you're not using the override?
368306293,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:33:33Z,still need that common builtin to get all the brdf parameters
368306320,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:33:58Z,wrap?
368306386,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:35:04Z,your fragment shader code is not dry
368306710,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:40:42Z,"you also need to override the vertex shader ouputs, you can't have a dangling uv out."
368306787,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-19T16:41:40Z,what about pbr shaders?
368314418,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:03:09Z,why?
368314711,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:07:35Z,"pbr shader exists for no reason and i can delete it just as well, its not used anywhere. all pbr params in mtl are non-standard (there's no `illum` in mtl that is using pbr params) and they are read and held in metadata just in case user wants to use them."
368314828,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:09:37Z,"no, why would i? for what?"
368314877,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:10:34Z,i think u need to read the code again
368315014,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:12:25Z,"idk, fixed"
368315402,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:19:43Z,"idk, seemed to me like a reasoneable default also for other attachments (i.e. blend params for all attachments are the same by default)"
368315491,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:21:14Z,"yea, i didnt know where to put them. another builtin loader?"
368317760,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T19:58:44Z,of course
368318886,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T20:15:32Z,"ofc it's not, it's glsl definition, i dont see a problem"

368319345,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T20:20:50Z,so u want me to remove paths and clamp flags from metadata? now it's just because ds was created in obj loader before
368319577,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T20:23:35Z,ok but why this c++ struct should have a particularly aligned address?

368324073,410,Crisspl,2020-01-19T21:26:02Z,they're cached because they're retval of the loader. i can cache any more (more than preventing from `clone()` in obj loader) because each mtl file results in unique metadata

373211881,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-30T21:49:22Z,"the lighting integral (for a point) is `integrate_over_hemisphere{incominglightdistribution(lightdirection)*brdf(observer,lightdirection,parameters)*cos(lightdirection),over all light directions}` the idea is that we split the integrand into two parts, one of which is the brdf and foreshortening term (ndotl), the other is the light distribution. we want to split that integral in 2 not 3 so `cos(theta)` has to go together with something, either the light distribution or the brdf. this is a good heuristic for multiple importance sampling, as we'll be sometimes sampling (picking directions) the points on area lights and sometimes the brdfs (directions with highest values). problem is that lights are well defined shapes which don't have nice contours on a hemisphere, and its hard to compute their areas (solid angles) as a function of (u,v) coordinates so its insanely hard to invert such a function to get uniform sampling. so just importance sampling an integrand close to 1 is near impossible for most shapes because of the contours of the integration domain, let alone when an integrand is cos(theta). so far triangles without the foreshortening (projection) are the only shape you can importance sample on a sphere under arbitrary transformations. furthermore squares, elliptical disks are only sampleable without a transform that includes shear. finally cylinders and spheres are only sampleable without a transform that includes shear or non-uniform scale. only one paper mentions sampling ""projected"" spherical caps (with the `cos` term). so overall it makes more sense to stick the `cos` together with the brdf, especially since for cook-torrance there is already a `4*ndotl*ndotv` in the denominator, so it will cancel out."

373667681,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-31T20:18:16Z,vec3 ior?
373671510,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-31T20:28:49Z,you can get that from isotropic paramters i think?
373785288,410,Crisspl,2020-02-01T15:22:59Z,thats the whole point of it that i cant get isotropic parameters in main() [a link]
373785316,410,Crisspl,2020-02-01T15:23:44Z,fresnel_dielectric takes ior as a single value
374051186,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T11:27:08Z,maybe we should add `bytesize` to augment the `relbyteoffset` of the `shdrin.descriptorsection.uniformbufferobject` ? then you wouldn't need all the matrix size constants above.
374051635,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T11:28:19Z,"why are you even bothering with cpu objects here, just create gpu descriptor set nr. 1 directly."
374054028,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T11:34:18Z,"ok, but there's really no reaon for it to not support a per-rgb channel ior value (the fresnel function itself)"

374060457,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T11:50:33Z,there's no `core::matrix3x4simd::pointer()` ?
374065813,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:04:42Z,i think your condition is a typo here.
374067243,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:08:18Z,also why is a cubemap in descriptor set 3? should be at least 2 or 1.
374067639,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:09:16Z,"btw the already provided inputs (push constants, material textures) shouldn't be in this metadata."
374068319,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:11:01Z,is it clear?
374069645,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:14:25Z,this should be added onto the end return value of `irr_computelighting`
374069677,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:14:30Z,just multiply `color` by it here.
374070270,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:16:08Z,still a todo
374074573,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:27:04Z,?
374074854,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:27:45Z,did you move this?
374075444,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:29:09Z,did you implement the warning and fallback?
374075580,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T12:29:32Z,make a mental note of this for next pr.
374119974,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T14:06:25Z,"yea, well im not sure why lagarde made it like this, i'm making it vec3"
374123909,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T14:14:00Z,"no, it's ok. why? what why? oh, ok, fine"
374126152,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T14:18:18Z,yea
374132168,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T14:28:52Z,"kinda, i guess, check out what i have now (blinn_phong, lambertian, oren_nayar cos_eval functions). i dont really know what is this incoming light distribution part. also i guess u'd like more `cos_eval` functions as builtins, i dont know which ones"
374152326,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T15:03:20Z,so should i have path to refl map in metadata instead + ecsi_ entry?
374165056,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T15:24:42Z,because he optimized to extremes
374166062,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T15:26:15Z,oh its just a badly named enum does mtl provide the cubemap or does the user provide the cubemap?
374171328,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T15:34:51Z,"mtl provides cubemap a little, `emp_refl_posx`, `emp_refl_negx`, etc.. are for loading images (see `cgraphicspipelineloadermtl::readtexture()`), then resulting cubemap image view goes to index `[emp_refl_posx]` of array resulting from `cgraphicspipelineloadermtl::loadimages()`"
374181343,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T15:51:25Z,great then we don't need the cubemap in the pipeline metadata that standardised metadata is only for things we need to provide to make the shader work (not to change it a bit).
374191556,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T16:07:59Z,"well, if u want it to be in set 1 or 2 then sure we do"
374194522,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-03T16:13:02Z,"well since mtl provides the environment map, it can be in set 3"
374201989,410,Crisspl,2020-02-03T16:25:51Z,"yea, in upcoming commit"
374540497,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T08:51:47Z,perfectly valid solution for default cpu to gpu asset converter
374540777,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T08:52:25Z,this can remain a float (all three channels are identical)
374575951,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T10:02:41Z,maybe sizeof the matrix types?
374576073,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T10:02:56Z,or sizeof the struct members?
374579363,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T10:09:19Z,i repeat the question
374587295,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-04T10:24:30Z,"its the shape all the lights make or an environment map (for ibl) basically brdf + cos functions i want: - lambertian - orren nayar - smooth specular (basically delta distribution given by `reflect` weighted by complex ior fresnel) - normalized phong with fresnel - ggx with correlated smith shadowing (same stuff as brdf explorer) - beckmann with the best geometry term you can find - ashkhim shirley anisortopic with the best geometry term you can find bsdf + cos functions (not in this pr): - smooth dielectric (basically two delta distributions with centers given by `reflect` and `refract`, mixed together by the fresnel) - thin dielectric (no refraction, but need to account for multiple fresnel and color shift) - rough dielectric with ggx - rough dielectric with beckmann - rough dielectric with ashkhin shirley p.s. for ahskmin shirley anisotropic use roughnesses (invert them like in brdf explorer), and for phong invert the roughness into the specular exponent."
375436916,410,Crisspl,2020-02-05T18:41:54Z,"oh, ok then"

375952102,410,Crisspl,2020-02-06T16:45:25Z,what is delta distribution?
375961665,410,Crisspl,2020-02-06T17:01:22Z,"sorry, didnt push yesterday"
375962572,410,Crisspl,2020-02-06T17:02:52Z,imo would seem a little weird that shader is builtin in the cache and other components of retval are not
375962836,410,Crisspl,2020-02-06T17:03:18Z,"done, no more cpu ubo"
376037666,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-06T19:31:26Z,"# was is das [a link] basically its 0 everywhere except at the center, at the center its undefined (you can return inf if argument==center). as a probability distribution it means there is 0 probability of getting any other random value than the center one, so your `sample` brdf function should always return the center coordinate with a probability weight of `max(cos(theta),0.0)` (original brdf / probability of sampling = delta/delta = 1, but then remember its `brdf_cos`). the most important part is the sampling property, you stick it as a product with another function inside any integral, the solution is the other function's value at the center of the dirac delta (without any gain or loss). this means that a mirror is a delta distribution centered around the reflected view-vector, so it basically tells you to sample the light distribution in only one place (the exact reflection). a smooth dielectric is two deltas, one at reflection vector, one at refraction vector, but they obviously have to be weighted together by the fresnel (not that it matters for the eval function). # more in depth about sampling multiple deltas however when sampling, you need to compute fresnel, and pick either to reflect or refract based on the input random value (use only one dimension). you can use the symmetry property of the bsdf and notice that it has to have the same values when you switch the observer and the light positions around, so it is possible to ""find"" the centers of the deltas given a viewer position. for a dielectric, there is the reflection where`ndoth` has to be 0, so h=n, and therefore l=-v the refraction you can also calculate in reverse (i'd do your own function instead of calling `refract`). [a link] due to symmetry, you can know the fresnel on a smooth dielectric by just knowing the viewer position (fresnel of `ndotv` will be the same as fresnel of `ndotl`, since v fixes reflective and refractive l vectors, and reflective fresnel fixes the transmittance). best choice is to pick to refract when `randomsample.x>fresnel` then the probability of picking the refracted ray is `1.0-fresnel` and reflected is `fresnel` which is exactly the same as their weights in the bsdf meaning that for the probability weight of the sampling function they cancel out and you return `abs(cos(theta),0.0)` (for bsdfs the foreshortening term is abs not max)."

376217783,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-07T05:15:09Z,`a==ndotsomething*inversesqrt(1-ndotsomething*ndotsomething)/(alpha)` instead of `a==1/(alpha*tan(acos(ndotsomething))`
376219214,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-07T05:23:38Z,put the walter approximation into a symbolic manipulation package (whatever we used for the fresnel correction last time) and let it simplify it for an equation in terms of `alpha` and `ndotsomething`
376614223,410,Crisspl,2020-02-07T21:24:20Z,what xd well thats fine
376642209,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-07T22:44:34Z,yeah basically if you wanted to be anal about it you'd return `params.ndoth!=1.0 ? 0.0:flt_inf` but there's no point in doing that except to waste gpus time.
376645786,410,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-07T22:56:21Z,"we factored out the denominator from the denominator for ggx. just like you should do here (albeit not by hand, use sagemath to simplify `1.0/((1.0+l_v+l_l)*4.0*params.ndotv)` in terms of `ndotv` and `ndotl`, so we have a `irr_glsl_ggx_smith_height_correlated_wo_numerator`)"

414827984,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-24T19:58:07Z,fragmentation
416053604,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-27T18:33:56Z,use environment variable `irr_override_device_extension_list` or something like that [a link]
416085678,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-27T19:23:21Z,to override the extension list we get from opengl driver in `copengldriver` or `copenglextensionhandler`

416155047,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-27T21:17:14Z,need more semantics about what the `/6/6/7/8/pagetable/physpgtex/getpgtabszlog2/getphyspgtexszrcp/getvtexszrcp/getphysicalidforlayer` mean...
416155186,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-27T21:17:31Z,is the reason
416939601,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-28T21:38:17Z,i think `swap` is default behavior of move ctors
416981344,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-28T23:20:15Z,these functions need to move to a different header
417355857,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:24:04Z,i need you to fix this and read the extension list in `copengldriver` from env-var if such is set
417360110,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:29:17Z,still an issue
417361717,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:31:18Z,why are packing offsets a constant array!? they were supposed to be ssbo!
417367611,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:38:44Z,why is the assignment of bits variable? shouldn't it be constant!?
417368785,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:40:07Z,didnt my final solution shader look differently here?
417369463,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:40:58Z,if they came from ssbo then you could collpase these lines [code block] into less

417376982,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:50:26Z,where's the ssbo with the layer to format lut ? and ubo with [code block] ?
417377505,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:51:07Z,still!
417377884,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:51:33Z,you can remove that comment
417379613,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:53:44Z,none of the headers have header guards nothing is overridable
417381673,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T14:56:20Z,what is `irr_glsl_vt_layer2pid` ?

417427688,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T15:57:40Z,"because page size is constant for all formats, so is `vtex_sz_rcp`"

417447883,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T16:27:11Z,this should probably be renamed to `irr_glsl_vtexture_helper` because its useful for `texturelod` as well

417491708,474,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-29T17:35:35Z,we could just remove this and turn `m_layertoviewindexmapping` into a struct

463770594,497,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-07-31T18:39:22Z,this debug thing should probably move to the per-layer loop

466975586,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:12:20Z,"why `+=`? then in case when you have layers 0,1,2,3, `inbaselayer` gets values 0,1,3,6. to fix!"
466976053,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:13:39Z,"`0, 0` not `1, 1`. actually it should be a loop over all texels encoded within the block"
466976777,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:15:22Z,"thats wrong for sure, `readblockpos` is an absolute position in input image. what you want is position in processed sub-image (with extent defined by `state->extent`)"
466978101,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:18:35Z,"why does it require scratch size to fit whole input image's texels? you need only just enough space to fit texels of processed sub-image (`state->extent`, not `inimage->extent`)"
466978635,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:20:02Z,"doesnt make sense at all, you are adding offset taken from output region to `indata`"
466979740,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T11:22:58Z,"ofc it's wrong, you're computing strides of output region with input image format info"

467038059,497,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T13:25:07Z,i think i've repeated it 5x times already
467038390,497,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T13:25:37Z,did you read my code and verify that `readblockpos` is relateive to mip-map's origin ?
467045894,497,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T13:38:35Z,ok
467055475,497,Crisspl,2020-08-07T13:54:21Z,"yes, it's absolute position within mip-level"

467071625,497,AnastaZIuk,2020-08-07T14:21:02Z,it should have been documented

470266840,497,Crisspl,2020-08-13T21:45:26Z,output format must always be not block-compressed (because we dont support `encodepixels` for block-compressed formats) so this is not needed
470267309,497,Crisspl,2020-08-13T21:46:34Z,"ah, u have comment about it here. anyway if you keep the loop, then you have to adjust `entryscratchaddress` accordingly"
470268869,497,Crisspl,2020-08-13T21:50:23Z,dont use c-style casts
470270077,497,Crisspl,2020-08-13T21:53:22Z,just use `readblockarrayoffset` the same way u do in `decode()`. nothing changes here. it's just named incorrectly

410436833,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T19:50:03Z,"nope, i can't remember but tga is sensitive to it as far as i remember it was previously commented it is required"
410438102,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T19:52:39Z,why? it calculates texels amount with pitch for `ef_a1r5g5b5_unorm_pack16` entry
410445073,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:08:31Z,mistake
410448389,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:16:01Z,you told me once i need to fly through regions to perform it per mipmaps
410448551,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:16:22Z,when i asked you what about mipmaped layered images
410449933,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:19:28Z,"there is no actually field such as ""mip level count"" in state, how can i do it?"
410450496,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:20:29Z,it's a single row image
410450650,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:20:49Z,it will give it's x texel amount
410450981,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:21:40Z,"okay, so i will exchange void* to icpubuffer"
410451224,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:22:07Z,em additionally it should be there [a link]
410452864,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:25:38Z,"for not bc format's it returns 1 rather, so it;s good i think"
410453867,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T20:27:58Z,"yeah it returns 1 for not bc, it's good"
410467774,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:01:18Z,the input is in texels as far as i know
410467854,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:01:28Z,so computed value is in texels as well
410468629,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:03:17Z,you mean?
410468780,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:03:39Z,:)
410470145,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:06:56Z,haven't you seen it? [a link]
410470534,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:07:50Z,you mean?
410470650,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:08:05Z,you mean?
410473296,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:14:38Z,"those are variables and pointers which value depends on final format, but i left is simmilar as it was before actually it just copy to a row needed for jpg library (and png does the same) for writing process, but it will warn if by some miracle format at that point isn's ef_r8_srgb or ef_r8g8b8_srgb"
410473335,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:14:45Z,it's good
410485625,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:47:28Z,"if you mean i have got 2 same vectors - look at their types, they are different so i have to do that"
410485639,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:47:30Z,"if you mean i have got 2 same vectors - look at their types, they are different so i have to do that"
410485942,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:48:12Z,i did it because my project could not see those files
410486517,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:49:22Z,maybe we should change it in cmake
410486994,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:50:36Z,fixed and tested
410487588,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-17T21:52:13Z,"that's why i asked you a few days ago how to get entire single layer, only one specified by the user"
410675871,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:44:42Z,itsn't true color 32bit rgba8 ?
410675987,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:46:32Z,"you're iterating over alll regions, ever you should be iterating over mipmaps [code block] the filter itself will get the appropriate regions and do operations on them (and clip the areas properly by itself as well)"
410676065,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:47:43Z,"`./3rdparty` is an include path already, you should be seeing it"
410676173,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:49:08Z,"you have control over the size of the image you're saving, you should know how many blocks it is anyway, not have to calculate it."
410676178,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:49:13Z,"you have control over the size of the image you're saving, you should know how many blocks it is anyway, not have to calculate it."
410676179,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:49:15Z,"you have control over the size of the image you're saving, you should know how many blocks it is anyway, not have to calculate it."
410676241,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:49:55Z,so why make this look like a generalpurpose function if its only intended to work with an image created with `iimageassethandlerbase::gettopimagedataforcommonwriting` ?
410676343,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:50:54Z,this is a gli loader! it loads bc1-7 images!
410676381,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:51:18Z,use smart pointers and move semantics
410676459,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:52:43Z,"ugh, the whole point of taking a `core::smart_refctd_ptr` was to avoid the memcpy, just take over the ownership of the buffer and use it!"
410676527,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:53:22Z,what are you doing?
410676758,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:55:15Z,wait why on earth are you making a single row image?
410677037,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:58:25Z,"its still dead, all 3 lines"
410677129,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T09:59:05Z,a ` ` conversion still costs!
410677325,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T10:01:33Z,"we have support for both rgb and bgr formats for textures, the loader must be reporting the format wrong (in the creation parameters) if it doesn't work without conversion"
410677361,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T10:02:13Z,we support that texture format 100%
410677582,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T10:04:32Z,"if you're going to use `asset::iimageassethandlerbase::calcpitchinblock` as a value any time that a ""texel count value is required"" the least you could do is assert that the block size is 1x1x1"
410678519,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:15:23Z,"cause tga did it before, there is likely a row stream provided by tga and it used convertcolor. i had to remake it at least"
410680121,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:32:27Z,ah you're right
410680480,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:36:07Z,why?
410680855,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:39:55Z,"tga loader and writer did it before, i know there there is and was a support for that, but not sure if i should change it. there were comments about it that tga requires it"
410680894,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:40:16Z,i know [a link]
410682856,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:58:52Z,"actually it depends, but will just take `bytespertexel`"
410682903,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T10:59:09Z,it may be rgb8 and rgba8
410684198,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:12:33Z,but it did not work for me
410684593,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:15:56Z,"image at that point is translated to have only top data, the writer encapsulates it's implementation, i don't find it much wrong solution"
410684658,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:16:42Z,but i don't undestand quite what you mean
410684754,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:17:36Z,"okay, i will use custom buffer allocator craetion"
410687215,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:41:09Z,i'm putting there true texel amount
410687449,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:43:40Z,"but it is in a loader, nobody will use it and we are sure it isn't bc"
410688009,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T11:50:52Z,okay
410688970,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T12:02:14Z,it doesn't cost anything
410689050,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T12:02:50Z,"there was a mistake, fixed"
410690779,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:20:25Z,great and then you do nothing with the copy buffer :facelpalm:
410691340,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:25:49Z,ah two memcpys
410691350,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:25:55Z,use `swap_ranges`
410691473,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:27:12Z,"just create an image in the native tga format, then `convert` at the end, dont do a weird 1d image per row"
410691537,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:27:50Z,this whole function's existence probably doesn't make sense at all
410691689,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:29:00Z,when building or intellisense?
410691976,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T12:31:42Z,when building
410692139,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:33:17Z,dont call `converttexeltoblocks` its confusing as fuck and its a noop for a png image
410692149,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:33:28Z,or make the blockinfo at all
410692864,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:39:41Z,"wondered if you could have done the `getpngconvertedoutput` straight from the input image view, and not call `gettopimagedataforcommonwriting`"
410694226,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:51:16Z,converter should work from bc formats (not to) actually
410694302,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T12:51:46Z,there is no memcpy
410694395,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:52:08Z,"you shouldn't run a conversion if the input and output formats match, then just run a flatten filter (much much faster)"
410694574,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:53:00Z,ok lets move this to [a link]
410694935,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:55:37Z,"just remove those conversions and test it without, i'm pretty sure it will work (if you fix everything along the way to report the format correctly)"
410694978,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T12:55:57Z,works for me and criss it seems on our branches
410695241,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T12:58:04Z,"but i need a convert, so filters usage -> i needed create an image"
410696016,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:04:11Z,yeah you probably don't need this
410696136,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T13:05:11Z,i think we need such a function in various writers
410696144,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:05:15Z,this needs logical fixing
410696150,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T13:05:20Z,there will be many code duplication otherwise
410696289,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T13:06:56Z,width is in texels
410696356,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T13:07:42Z,"since texelblockbytesize may be in texels or blocks, we need to make sure byte size will be in texels , input may be various"
410696451,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T13:08:16Z,to final calculate row pitch in texels
410696540,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:08:50Z,you should assert that block size == 1x1x1
410697116,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:14:36Z,"to be honest there's no reason for `iimageassethandlerbase::gettopimagedataforcommonwriting` to exist, if you have a function like this (it could just take an image view as an input instead of image)"
410697208,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:15:12Z,"seems like png and jpg writer could use the same function. i have the exact same comment here: - don't convert if formats match, use flatten instead - take imageview as input - get rid of `gettopimagedataforcommonwriting` you could do this all in here"
410697383,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:17:05Z,"also don't convert the entire, whole image, just the miplevel+arraylayer you're actually doing to write out ;)"
410697392,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:17:12Z,icpuimageview
410697613,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:18:28Z,ok
410697722,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T13:19:06Z,"you can get rid of the switch, `convertedimage` will 100% be in only these two formats"
410702045,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:04:27Z,"it's correct, any input to any output except bc (it's png)"
410705120,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T14:30:20Z,"you probably want to use a different function to get the screensize, this will give you the current size of whatever the current fbo bound is"
410705332,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T14:32:39Z,"placing the fence does not stall the cpu, you need to wait on the fence with `idriverfence::waitcpu` before you acess the igpubuffer's new data with the cpu, for example, through a mapping"
410705591,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:34:17Z,blockinfo is better to me since final true extent take pitch into account cuz your functions deals with row buffer length afaik
410705711,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:35:39Z,i wrote it in previous pr in fence header
410708327,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:57:53Z,"why? it's png loader, the dim won't be different from 1x1x1"
410708542,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:59:03Z,"i changed it a little bit, now it's wonderful"
410708574,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T14:59:19Z,"yeah, to fill in docs"
410709086,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T15:03:37Z,"i think my code will be cleaner with my approach, but i will optimalize memcpy to get rid of it"
410709294,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T15:05:07Z,there is only 1 memcpy
410713382,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T15:38:22Z,okay in next commit there will be no any memcpy
410715037,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-18T15:52:39Z,to fix
410762907,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:40:19Z,"wrong, do it in texels"
410763515,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:43:47Z,"if you dont plan on supporting downloading multi-mip level image views then assert that they only have one mipmap level.... or make more regions also you're not specifying the parameters correctly given the image view, the image view defines the subresource (layer offset, miplevel offset, and their counts), if i pass a really large (layers and mips) gpu image to this function i will end up having an icpuimage with just as many layers and mips, except that it will only be partially covered by one region"
410763673,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:44:41Z,this is the only fence you need
410763869,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:45:56Z,"you don't need the fence here, the only thing you want to wait on is accessing the `texelbuffer->getpointer()` pointer because you don't want to look at (read) that memory area before the gpu writes to it all the mapping, etc. can still be going on while gpu is working."
410764264,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:48:39Z,"unmapping memory makes the pointer go invalid, the `asset::ccustomallocatorcpubuffer getmappedpointer()==texelbuffer->getpointer()` holds as long as memory is mapped (and if its not `texelbuffer->getpointer()` now has a stale and garbage pointer) you should unmap after we're done using the `texelbuffer` which in this case is after you have called to `trytowrite`"
410764384,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-18T22:49:23Z,i'd just make these match 100% with `image` and have the subresource encompass the whole `image` and be done with it.
410969671,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-19T19:07:27Z,i specify image view params bellow

411216689,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-20T09:07:51Z,tbd... tga needs its own special review. this function is used only by tga right?
411217937,468,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-20T09:09:49Z,"the function is moved to tga loader, since it's specific to it"
411218478,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-20T09:10:32Z,you should place the fence as soon as possible (line 149) but you wait as late as possible (line 178 just before trytowrite) also you have an unused variable/fence called `fence`
411219413,468,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-20T09:11:54Z,ok moved to tga

522485052,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-12T22:53:50Z,move this and the test for `if (cosfactor>flt_min)` to the very top

522511239,554,Crisspl,2020-11-12T23:46:01Z,thats why i didnt even bother with proper twosided handling
522991302,554,Crisspl,2020-11-13T14:39:37Z,"it is blend-like, but has different opcode. honestly i cant see any point in unifying them further, in the end of the day they differ a lot (first of all blend takes weight from bsdf_data or texture and coating computes it). so there would be a need for flag determining how weights are obtained which already stands for divergence between most of the work done by the opcode"
524262127,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:21:00Z,we could allow a rough difftrans (in the ir) at no extra cost (excution or complexity)
524265984,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:27:23Z,reading and writing data to random registers might be expensive... so it would be nice not to diverge for that (which is why single opcode is nice)
524269469,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:32:45Z,you forgot to clamp all the `dot` variables before using them... also a quick check for the **after clamp value** of `ndotl` coudl save you a lot of computation here (and data fetches)
524270666,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:34:47Z,can support rough difftrans at no cost
524272008,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-16T13:37:07Z,use a proper branch... otherwise you're doing 2x the memory fetches also its not `ndotv` that you must use (interpolated shading normals can fuck this up) .... but take in a boolean `frontface` which in the rasterization shader would be `gl_frontfacing`

526500143,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-18T23:53:26Z,why don't you just do `g2_over_g1` here and then mul the thing by `pdf` after you get it.. since the pdf is exactly the other part (`g1_over_2ndotv * ndf_val *0.5` for conductor and the other thing for dielectric refraction) ?
526501255,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-18T23:56:15Z,basically it should be [code block]
526501797,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-18T23:57:42Z,listen to me... and only compute the remainder [a link] mul by pdf at the end!
526502824,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T00:00:31Z,conductor need to be a blend
526503238,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T00:01:45Z,instead of weight.. use `out_pdf` right away [a link]
526503583,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T00:02:34Z,could have been `out_pdf *= pdf` also good to call it `localpdf` instead of `pdf`
526504617,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T00:05:31Z,dont use `cos_eval_dg` .. break them down just like you did the remainder functions in the remainder stream

526799111,554,Crisspl,2020-11-19T11:36:25Z,setting initial interaction with correctly oriented normal
526885195,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T13:32:52Z,"i told you that it should depent on an input boolean (which would usually be `gl_frontfacing` passed to this function) and not the dot product of the view vector with the normal, because the normal could have been a smooth interpolated normal!"
526929049,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T14:28:30Z,delete it then
526929110,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T14:28:34Z,delete it them
526931518,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T14:31:49Z,applicable to brdf leafs only. only stuff that has nothing to do with the pdf computation (so all data except for roughness) and computation of fresnel and g2.
526970294,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T15:20:27Z,i messed up and gave bad advice

526973805,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T15:24:45Z,pass the skip into `instr_eval_and_pdf_execute` you have divergence for doing the exact same thing (decoding registers and writing the result)
526974227,554,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-11-19T15:25:16Z,and remember to init `pdf = skip ? 0.0:1.0;`

467324077,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:17:24Z,i'd still like to see you use the `icpumeshbuffer` static methods to advance and compute pointers if possible
467324304,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:18:34Z,move to `include/irr/asset/`
467324400,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:19:00Z,do you even need these anymore?
467324711,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:20:25Z,?
467324835,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:20:58Z,especially the static methods of `icpumeshbuffer`
467325145,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-07T23:22:26Z,definitely looks like you are
467628835,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-09T21:06:05Z,do `mat3(matrices[boneid].normalmatrix)*normalize(normal)`
467628981,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-09T21:07:38Z,missing normal matrix?
467629013,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-09T21:08:17Z,"for this benchmark to be sane, you need far more than 64 disks, i'm thinking upwards of 16 thousand."

468059179,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T17:20:26Z,do a hack `gl_position.xyz += mat3(matrices[boneid].normalmatrix) * normalize(normal)`
468071674,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T17:43:12Z,so you dont need to have an output `vnormal`
468110681,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T18:54:28Z,also a cool thing would be to ensure that `abs(gl_position.z) > abs(gl_position.w)` which will send the triangles outside the ndc bounds and ensure no pixels get rasterized. an idea would be to do this [code block]
468120934,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T19:13:59Z,you can pass such defines via the iglslcompiler remind us how xd ?
468123268,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T19:18:32Z,`(device->run() && receiver.keepopen())` not in benchmark mode

468124382,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T19:20:43Z,`glflush` afterwards or you risk an infinite wait.
468125036,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T19:21:58Z,"you need one `driver->beginscene` at the start and then set the correct fbo (depth only, really low resolution)"

468136713,496,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-10T19:37:28Z,i want thousands of disks

358142035,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-16T10:00:06Z,you could do `datatosend = texelbuffer->getpointer()` instead of wasting a copy.
358145988,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-16T10:08:00Z,"doesn't openexr have a function other than `readrgba` that will give you quantized `uint16_t/halffloat` directly instead of dequantizing into full floats? also your image format you declared as rgba half float above, your buffers are also same size as a half float image, and here you're reading full floats and then memcpying them to buffer. this will be a disaster."
358147478,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-16T10:10:58Z,"you need to know when file is `imfrgba` (half) and you need `ef_r16g16b16a16_sfloat` [a link] and when we have `rgba` (full float) and you need `ef_r32g32b32a32_sfloat` [a link] i don't know if openexr allows for mixed precision channels (r half, g full) if you find out that it does, then convert to highest one present (if one channel is 32bit, then all 32bit)."

359025064,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-17T20:58:59Z,calcpitchinblocks doesn't take alignment into account
359025495,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-17T21:00:03Z,as i can see they call rgba something that uses their `half`s being 16 bit precision floats
359025946,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-17T21:01:08Z,"see the struct declarations/definitions, there's one for full floats and one for half."

359035379,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-17T21:23:11Z,"well, because of that they provide this though, it will be good for me [a link]"
359059478,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-17T22:19:55Z,you dont' want to convert an array of ilmhalf is good to do a straight copy to a buffer for an ef_r16g16b16a16_sfloat texture
359528425,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-18T19:29:53Z,"well, i checked it and this is a copy of png loader `calcpitchinblocks` what did i miss?"

360474934,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-20T17:15:17Z,the alpha checks will cause a texture with a present but different alpha format to rgb to register as a non-alpha texture (should fail instead)
360477420,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-20T17:23:02Z,why are you extracting rgba into 4 separate planes?
360477540,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-20T17:23:23Z,are you sure the strides are in pixels and not bytes?
360477736,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-20T17:24:00Z,this is what i refer to in [a link]
360644402,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:36:04Z,to fix
360644412,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:36:31Z,"it was wronged, fixed without aligement"
360644441,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:37:06Z,"everything is done well, i've read a few pages of their documentation"
360644515,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:38:46Z,"because they provide rgba class, but don't provide rgb. actually i find it better approach for data assignment and more clear, because we base on available channels"
360644527,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:39:16Z,"well, and in that way you can specify slice to make sure ilm reads type and handle it correctly"
360644578,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:40:05Z,"there are x y z channels, but do we want to support it?"
360644653,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T11:41:28Z,"sure, to fix!"
360650807,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T14:03:37Z,"so assume i'm handling 250th pixel, what should i fill it with if it's fake actually?"
360651065,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T14:10:31Z,i'm filling those fake values with 0
360651582,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-21T14:23:10Z,"dont fill fake with anything, it wont ever be used. you just need to change your array output addressing code, from `x+y*realwidth` to `x+y*bufferrowlength`"
360651622,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-21T14:24:17Z,great
361005200,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:23:26Z,we should proabably make a macro out of this or a template utility function.
361007414,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:35:11Z,"you need an error out else, people might call it with stupid formats images (or low dynamic range images)."
361007544,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:35:50Z,"instead of using unintelligible costants such as 2,4 use `sizeof(uint16_t)`,`sizeof(float)`"
361007835,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:37:28Z,"nope, bad stride, you need stride all pixels at once (so sizeof whole pixel)"
361010706,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:53:10Z,"you need a per component offset here, 0 for red, one unit for green, two units for blue, etc."
361010773,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T21:53:39Z,you could do the bufferrowlength*pixelsize
361012028,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:00:50Z,what do you mean by doesn't work? doesn't compile? the macro might not like the pointer type going in (is it a void* ?)
361012205,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:01:51Z,"you're only writing 720 pixels of a 1280x720 image here, just saying."
361012392,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:02:56Z,"same bugs as before. i'd actually make a width x height ""framebuffer"" (just an array) and copy regions to it manually as necessary."
361012620,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:04:15Z,"this will be potentially different for every region, this is why you need to reserve the correct image sized buffer and copy pixels manually (construct the image from regions)"
361012824,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:05:29Z,"wrong, you need to iterate through regions, and then `x,y` need to go from `offset` to `offset+extent` then obviously use all the other region struct parameters to get the pixels out of the buffer."
361013214,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:07:45Z,thx for this
361013615,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-23T22:10:12Z,why ?
361045009,403,Crisspl,2019-12-24T02:12:31Z,ctor is inaccessible for make_smart...() func
361109229,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:00:48Z,"because i insert a layout for one channel. it's the openexr library job to perform appropriate calculations and save it properly. just save a file, you will see it is correct"
361109632,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:02:27Z,and it's outdated
361109647,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:02:31Z,outdated
361109766,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:02:59Z,"it doesn't compile, and type is known by the template"
361110426,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:05:33Z,"it's good, the parameter of this specifies how many scan lines it should write if i were to put there 1, it would save 1280 x 1 image because above i describe the end layout, it saves it correctly"
361111091,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:08:18Z,it's done well that's what it is pixelsarrayilm keeps colors matched to single channel [a link]
361111290,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:09:08Z,there is only one region :d
361113097,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:16:10Z,"and it actually saves a file properly, i've tested it"
361113812,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:19:25Z,"important is that i have to insert each channel separately because rgba class forces you to use half format that's why i pass to it such an array , to overpass it and insert channels that may have different types (half, full float and uint32_t) so it's correct"
361114420,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:21:52Z,and it isn't void*
361114732,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T09:23:11Z,"well, so where should it be put in files?"
361128650,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:20:44Z,errors from compiler?
361128696,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:20:59Z,ah ok. cool
361130910,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:30:18Z,"no goddamn it, i can give you an image with 50 regions in the spec and you need to be able to save it!"
361130950,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T10:30:29Z,![a link]
361131039,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:30:50Z,"ah ok, then use `create`"
361131367,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:32:14Z,"yeah because the region encompasses the whole image, and you haven't been handed a difficult case yet."
361132103,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:35:07Z,"if you set up the offset (pointer), stride (penultimate parameter) and row length (last parameter) properly, you'll be able to basically `memcpy` entire rows."
361132745,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:37:21Z,probably a template static function in `iasset`
361133064,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:38:37Z,call it `castdown`
361134723,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:44:49Z,try making the pointer into a constant pointer and let me know (compiler might get confused).
361137830,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-24T10:59:39Z,"ok i might have fucked this one up in the following lines [a link] i use `std::remove_pointer` but i should also then wrap it in `std::remove_reference` first. the compiler is moaning about the fact that the type being passed into the templates is a reference to a type (after you put a pointer type into a `std::remove_pointer` you get a reference type, not the straight vanilla type). so feel free to correct my macros ;)"
361164843,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T13:29:38Z,"macros fixed, but it still doesn't work, but it works with & and works if you create `ilmtype* poitner` and try to delete it"
361164945,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T13:30:06Z,to fix
361166608,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T13:40:42Z,so actualy i only have to copy to pixelsarrayilm pixels correctly having regions taken into account
361184212,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-24T15:12:47Z,for each loop works as well
361531412,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-26T20:54:19Z,"curious is that if you perform for each loop when an element is a reference pointer while deallocating memory, it spreads out the same errors"
361677327,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-27T14:38:17Z,"nope, you can get ths from image creation parameters"
361678247,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-27T14:42:27Z,region also specifies a byte offset into the beginning of the buffer.
361679551,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-27T14:49:05Z,but won't it affect then with another mipmap levels? unless image creation parameters hold extent for the buffer assuming 0 mipmap level as base level for each region
361680021,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-27T14:51:36Z,"i know, but isn't it good? if not, how should i combine a byte offset into the beginning of the buffer with `ptrstyleendshifttoimagedatapixel`?"
361680983,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-27T14:56:47Z,do i need it if i specify a begginging of each pixel using `ptrstyleendshifttoimagedatapixel`?
361836808,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-29T09:13:41Z,image creation parameters must create an image big enough so all regions in the list are valid (i.e. can fit inside)
361931247,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T09:01:30Z,so its done or not?
361931852,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T09:04:31Z,"it's done, above shows you the behaviour"
361935746,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T09:21:55Z,wait what!?
361935782,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T09:22:03Z,the f***?
361967942,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T11:52:25Z,could still keep it const if you made a new constructor for icpushader
361968199,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T11:53:43Z,can you do this for all loaders (and obviously pick good defaults)
361968251,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T11:54:01Z,sure!
361968344,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T11:54:32Z,"after pr merging of course, before i handle gli"
361968564,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T11:55:45Z,why is this not factored out to a common static function for some base class like `iimageloader` and `iimagewriter`
361968821,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T11:57:04Z,should i put it into `iimageloader`? i can handle it as well after merging
361968837,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T11:57:09Z,"do a pure virtual destructor, do the constructor as a default"
361968939,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T11:57:42Z,no need for a cpp file for this
361969023,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T11:58:11Z,it'll be deleted
361969446,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T12:00:35Z,its an asset writer! make a `iimagewriter` that inherits from `iassetwriter` please return `iassetwriter` to virtual inheritance from `ireferencecounted`
361969574,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T12:01:22Z,it was correct before.
361972870,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T12:19:58Z,"wrong, general equation is `((z*height+y)*width+x)*pixelorblocksize+byteoffset` height and width are not the image extent visual/gometrucal parameters, but buffer jumps: see [a link]"

362004038,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T14:46:18Z,"we can support single r channel, rg channel combo and rgb channel combo"

362013422,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T15:19:30Z,where did you get the general equation from? could you give me a reference?
362014661,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T15:24:28Z,"if no channel, what value should i fill it with?"

362026880,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T16:08:33Z,now it doesn't work
362037810,403,Crisspl,2019-12-30T16:49:14Z,"first of all: image texel format size varies, so you cannot iterate over `reinterpret_cast (data)`. iterate bytewise instead. now your `ptrstyleendshifttoimagedatapixel` includes `bufferoffset` and then used to increment ptr of type `ilmtype*`. so ptr is getting moved by `sizeof(ilmtype)*bufferoffset` bytes. idk why actually you are iterating over ilmtype array since (as i said) channel size varies (half=2bytes or float=4bytes) and ilmtype has constant size (cpp is statically typed), but anyway: to get ptr to texel you need to use equation matt gave you. if exr is always 2d image (i dont know), you can simplify it to `(y*width+x)*pixelorblocksize+byteoffset`. it's theoretically the same what you have now, but yours is weird because this iterating over `ilmtype*` thing. so in practice: [code block]"
362040542,403,Crisspl,2019-12-30T17:00:33Z,"ah, ilmtype is template param, ok. anyway everything above applies"
362046710,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T17:25:33Z,thank you ! i have reorganized the code and now it works i should have perform calculations without using bytewise shifts
362048233,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T17:31:34Z,i need to create for it cpp file however
362068327,403,Crisspl,2019-12-30T18:59:01Z,better call `gettexelorblockbytesize` once and save to some var. this call is quite big switch so maybe better no to call it in a loop
362082120,403,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-30T19:58:41Z,"you're right, i saved it"
362084628,403,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-30T20:10:19Z,"there are r16 and r32 formats as well as rg16 and rg32, rgb is special cause it would be not power of two (npot) so it doesnt exists and you use rgba instead"

460457949,521,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-07-25T23:44:19Z,all my comments basically boil down to: - see how `convertcolor<>` works - decompose it into a separate decode+encode - put a clamp between the decode and the encode depending on the constexpr bool template parameter

376723363,411,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-08T17:47:29Z,iterate over region layers!
376723430,411,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-08T17:48:32Z,you don't need this lambda
376723473,411,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-08T17:49:17Z,you shall not call boolean functions every loop iteration!
376817716,411,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-09T21:37:07Z,still wrong

289023781,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T14:48:20Z,you could have just did the following [code block]
289025250,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T14:51:10Z,i think its important to have zeros in the zw output coordinate so save to a temporary and call `makesafe2d` before returning

289029434,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T14:59:28Z,i swear there has to be a faster check
289029687,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T15:00:00Z,there are no 2d line classes in the engine so you can nuke those
289029747,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T15:00:08Z,this needs a better name
289030140,307,Przemog1,2019-05-30T15:00:59Z,suggestions?
289030205,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-30T15:01:08Z,"nope because if one wants to do float they can use implicit vectorsimdf constructor like this `somebox.reset({x,y});`"

289375027,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-31T12:47:34Z,same for the other vector type

289580152,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-31T23:48:46Z,why are you doing a compare against a vectorsimdf?
289580424,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-31T23:51:03Z,also this comparison op only works for signed ints you'd need to use crtp and make vectorsimd_32 a common base class (as `vectorsimd_32 >`) for actual `vectorsimdu32` and `vectorsimdi32` (instead of them being typedefs as they are now)
289580521,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-31T23:51:57Z,shift right behaves differently on signed vs unsigned (whether it shifts in copies of the sign bit)
289600484,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T10:31:57Z,oops
289602355,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T11:53:55Z,"i'm going to use it only for aabbsimdu (unsigned int aabb) in getcenter() function, where i need to divide by 2."
289602463,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T11:56:45Z,i.e. [code block]
289603999,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T12:59:03Z,that's fine(ish) but you've just added a >> operator to a class that provides both `vectorsimd32u` and `vectorsimd32i` so you've introduced a bug
289604160,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T13:05:06Z,actually this function is called `getedges` but its actually `getvertices` if you look at the definition in `aabbox3d<>` its for getting the corners (you can rename if you like)
289604362,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T13:13:01Z,sign flip missing
289608484,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T15:07:40Z,_mm_srli_epi32 will do for unsigned int?
289608735,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T15:17:06Z,correct
289615912,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T19:20:18Z,this class will be moved to aabbsimdi.h ofc
289616442,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T19:41:09Z,you want to template on `core::vector2di32_simd`
289616505,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T19:45:08Z,right
289617401,307,Przemog1,2019-06-01T20:23:51Z,"it can be shared between aabbsimdi and aabbsimdu only, aabbsimdf needs also sign flip operation"
289618564,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T21:15:15Z,getminedge and getmaxedge you'll actually have to specialize
289618583,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T21:16:06Z,reset can be done as an move assignment (`operator=(&&)`) of a new box created from a point
289618690,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T21:21:40Z,the unpack lo and unpack hi comparison will work here too
289618730,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-01T21:23:27Z,"dont use the negative minimum convention for integers, due to range issues"

289640281,307,Przemog1,2019-06-02T12:25:45Z,why it doesn't compile?
289643739,307,Przemog1,2019-06-02T13:58:19Z,only this function will vary between aabb2dsimdi and aabb2dsimdu i believe
289644989,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:30:59Z,you don't need a swizzle your constructors will work with random stuff in zw
289644996,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:31:11Z,now you need an `std::move`
289645065,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:32:50Z,still missing `2d` in the name
289645089,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:33:29Z,sneaky way of solving this ;)
289645124,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:34:25Z,"you need `(int_max,int_max,int_min,int_min)` i told you that beacuse of the ranges you won't be able to use the same ""one sse op"" trick as for the `vectorsimdf` based solution"
289645140,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:34:56Z,if you implement all the comparison operators in the vectorsimd32* types then yes.
289645162,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:35:27Z,"we don't quite support c++17, but we have out own workaround called `irr::static_if` if i remember correctly"

289645382,307,Przemog1,2019-06-02T14:41:11Z,wtf i did xd
289645407,307,Przemog1,2019-06-02T14:41:45Z,whats the reason to not support c++17?
289645438,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:42:30Z,actually if you did [code block] then you could get away just with `operator<`

289645640,307,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-02T14:47:53Z,sure because `get*edge` returns a normal natural 2d point and `reset` + `addpoint` should work on it just fine

165816387,21,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-03T14:43:14Z,again this needs to be checked if it not past the end of the file.

165816610,21,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-03T14:52:37Z,"if you already have a `createdobjects` member in the context, then there is no need for a wascreated flag. you can just use `std::map::find` to try-get the created object. or if you are scared of using two logn operations, then instead of `bool wascreated` have a `void* createdobj` and ditch the `createdobjects' member - which now after i wrote this, seems a better idea."
165816644,21,Crisspl,2018-02-03T14:54:01Z,thanks to the flag i don't need to look for an object in map to determine if it was loaded or not

165818020,21,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-03T16:01:25Z,"the other argument for making this a function of the blob, is that if someone wants to extend the loading system with their own blob types, then they won't need to touch cbawmeshfileloader at all or any other loading and saving systems"

512207006,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:14:47Z,should take a `uint32_t _levelsbelow` parameter
512208752,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:18:02Z,ugh this is so coupled.
512212611,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:24:59Z,"oh, we already discussed it"
512213380,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:26:17Z,just remind me of the corner case that would break a `_levelsbelow` parameter version?
512218571,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:35:28Z,but i'd instead add a `mutability` argument to the function with ` iasset::em_cpu_persistent` as the default parameter so user doesn't have to do the long form of first inserting an asset and then changing its mutability to what he actually wants
512221452,549,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-26T19:40:40Z,"no that's not what i meant, i mean that you pass a bundle of some type, then use the bundle's cache key value to try and get a fresh load (badly because only top level will be duplicated and for restore you need the full dag). then you dont limit the asset types you will retrieve/load from `getassetinhierarchy` so the bundle you might get back could be a different length and even type. furthermore you `assert` and not fail gracefully if you dont get same size bundle. then you restore without extra checks. its basically a surefire way to program termination either via `assert` or trying to restore assets from different types. basically the usefulness of this method approaches 0"
512563772,549,Crisspl,2020-10-27T10:12:32Z,"anything, you want to restore pipeline to the level of pipeline layout so you check only those levels but it might turn out that pipelines are incompatible on some lower level (ds layouts for example)"

496191387,487,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-09-28T19:45:46Z,"it would be possible to only have one copy of `key`, it would need a bit of a hack. you'd need to change `unordered_map ` to `unordered_set , equalswrapper >` then you'd reserve the `invalid_iterator` to mean ""input key to the function"" (making a huge assertion here that `m_shortcut_map` can never contain `invalid_iterator`). what would happen is that you could define your own `struct hashwrapper` and `struct equalswrapper` which thanks to c++11 could actually be made stateful and store the reference to the `m_list`, as well as `const key* invalid_iterator_key;` and `std::size_t invalid_iterator_hash;`, you'd construct the wrappers in the constructor of `lrucache` and pass them into the constructor of `m_shortcut_map`. then whenever you call `m_shortcut_map.find`, you'd first set the pointer to `invalid_iterator_key` and compute the `invalid_iterator_hash` for the stateful wrappers. then whenever the `operator()` of either the hash or equals gets called: - if the value is `invalid_iterator` return the relevant state's hash or use the state's pointer for the `operator==` - if the value is not `invalid_iterator` then fetch the relevant node from `m_list` use it's pair's `key` member for hash or compare"

499191368,487,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-03T23:49:09Z,why are you returning pointers instead of references?
499191580,487,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-03T23:53:21Z,"todo: i don't like having a duplicate `key` lingering around. also another solution would be to swap out the `key` in unordered map for a `key*` in the `unordered_map` (don't need a weird `unordered_set` anymore) however the hash and equals would still need to be wrapped to dereference the pointer. the `key*` pointer would need to point to the `snode<>.value.first` so its basically almost a duplicate of the `uint32_t` field, at which point we degenerate into the `unordered_set` solution."

500219146,487,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-06T12:02:17Z,this should have been a malloc/free not a new/delete
378544290,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-12T22:15:00Z,we can get rid of `parent`
378555342,422,Crisspl,2020-02-12T22:41:39Z,at all? won't it be needed for vulkan implementation?

379174810,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-13T23:23:42Z,doesnt this change affect a lot more?

379175536,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-13T23:26:09Z,wrong thing to cache
379175755,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-13T23:26:49Z,can you cache this compiler?

379218741,422,Crisspl,2020-02-14T02:06:51Z,it does but i changed everything
379219034,422,Crisspl,2020-02-14T02:08:20Z,hm?
379219154,422,Crisspl,2020-02-14T02:08:54Z,"yea, it has"
379846388,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T18:04:59Z,"we shouldn't be caching the spir-v shader, just the hash of the shader instead."
379846613,422,Crisspl,2020-02-15T18:09:27Z,"yea, yea, ofc it does. this last param is just wrong approach to something else, doesnt matter, sorry. will rework it today"
379847661,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T18:27:21Z,ok.
379848106,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T18:35:45Z,shouldn't hash be in `copenglshader` the unspecialized one?
379848173,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T18:36:35Z,also the spir-v?
379848227,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T18:37:37Z,that can move to the pipeline since that will hold program objects now.
379849516,422,Crisspl,2020-02-15T19:00:58Z,"no, why? unspecialized shader has nothing to do with pipelines + unspecialized shader holds spirv or glsl, while specialized always holds spirv"
379861064,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T22:48:41Z,hash of either is fine. are there any mutations that get applied to the glsl after we create an `igpushader` ?
379862247,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T23:20:03Z,why?
379862330,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T23:22:12Z,`const` the `_glnames`
379862887,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T23:35:48Z,"because you're using separable programs, the uniform locations can be precomputed (will be identical for all usages across all threads and pipelines) for a specialized shader (from a single compilation) and ""cached"" inside of the specialized shader"
379863024,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T23:40:02Z,shouldn't layout be the key? just like specialization would be?
379863092,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-15T23:41:26Z,in `irr_debug` assert that
379866990,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T01:03:29Z,"well, yea, like everything. #include resolvements, binding reorders, push constants to uniform translation, specialization constants resolvements"
379867062,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T01:05:47Z,no because there's no way to make an operator< for it
379918481,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T17:16:24Z,that's on the glsl generated from spir-v. but yeah i remember the run-time extension `include`s
379923129,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T18:28:06Z,layout should be in the key though? since we want to get the full driver dependent shader binary (and that depends on glsl generated from spir-v which depends on the layout)
379923220,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T18:29:46Z,dont put this in the hot loop (stuttering) actually intialize at the start.
379923233,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T18:30:02Z,same as [a link]
379923895,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T18:40:26Z,look in code that actually finds binaries
379926229,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T19:17:04Z,"let's invent one (don't actually give it a `operator<` but use a `map` with a custom comparator functor struct. you can treat a layout as a 4d vector/array of descriptor layouts, so implement a `<` operator like you would for a 4bit lsb int (first set `<`, then if first set `==` then check second set, and so on) then a `<` function for descriptor layouts could be defined the same as you define a `<` operator for an `std::array`"
379926853,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T19:26:19Z,"use a single-threaded cache, and mutex the shit out of the pipeline, just using a thread-safe cache won't make the member functions of the owner safe to call from multiple threads."
379927034,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-16T19:29:12Z,its possible to implement a comparator using very similar logic to this: [a link]

379930182,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T20:18:20Z,"u dont want just a comparator, u want a clearly defined relation"

379930650,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T20:25:12Z,"they're precomputed once for all threads, however u're right that those can be stored in copenglspecializedshader, i'll change it"
379931081,422,Crisspl,2020-02-16T20:31:24Z,"because `getshaderglnameforctx` might create the gl name and `getuniformlocationsforstage` will need gl name to query locations (ofc locations are cached once queried, but order of those calls are still important for the first time when locations are yet unknown)"

379946529,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:10:12Z,"well in order for a spir-v to give you the same glsl shader, the layout needs to be fully compatible, which means that all descriptor sets need to be identically defined. fun fact, how stl implements all algorithms in terms of just `<`: a b: `b compatibility between layouts a and b says nothing about compatibility a and d well compatibility for a shader binding reordering requires full compatibility, so if a and b are compatible for shader x and c is compatible with a or b up to set 4, then c will be compatible as the descriptor set layouts are identically defined. p.s. another way to establish a `<` relation is to first compare shader hash, then specialization info, and then the computed (set,binding) to (type,binding) remappings which could be cached in `copenglpipelinelayout` similarily to precomputed multibind params [a link]"
379946843,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:14:19Z,"we could just create all the thread's programs (all the duplicates) at once during pipeline creation so we never, ever, stutter during a frame. we should always compile/create at least one shader program upon pipeline creation and hence the uniform locations should be queried at that time and stored in the specialized shader (they will be identical for all following copies). to avoid any hitches during rendering."
379946861,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:14:39Z,ok
379949301,422,Crisspl,2020-02-17T00:41:58Z,done
379949670,422,Crisspl,2020-02-17T00:45:55Z,actually only the 2nd one so u want to create for all threads at once? now pipeline irrbaw objects store binaries and create gl names from it when a thread wants to use the pipeline
379949807,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:47:14Z,"there's probably an overhead in creating a new shader even from a binary, so maybe doing all up-front is a better idea."
379949936,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:48:32Z,what if there are no uniforms at all? will we keep on hitting this?
379949970,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:48:50Z,ah nvm its in `compile` so only one hit ever.
379951151,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T00:59:44Z,you're leaking binaries?
379951380,422,Crisspl,2020-02-17T01:02:02Z,"no, binaries are stored in smart array. it's in a raw one because of alignment"
379951423,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T01:02:26Z,do we always need to make a new array?

379951658,422,Crisspl,2020-02-17T01:04:14Z,so what's the upper bound?
379951977,422,Crisspl,2020-02-17T01:07:03Z,"not ever, every time pipeline with this shader is created. yes, we hit every time then. and then it runs 0 iterations loop so whatever"
380015203,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T07:18:05Z,argh shit `m_glnames` and `m_uniformssetfortheveryfirsttime` actually needs a dynamic allocation (but you could join the `gluint` and `bool` into a single struct/pair and only have one dynamically allocated array). but `m_shaderbinaries` you only need up to max_stages_per_pipeline (which is your template paramater right now).
380015283,422,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-02-17T07:18:21Z,"yeah, i realized"

[a link] which means that you also need to modify column 3 to add a `jitter` proportional factor for the viewspace z component, so the vanishing line/point stays the same in world coordinates."

327763146,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-24T18:15:22Z,`static_cast` works beautifully because it can calculate the relative offset to the pointer accounting for the difference between the start of storage of a base class and a derived class. example [code block] if you print both `base` and `derived` as `%p` you will see that the pointer to derived has been rolled back by 4 bytes. `reinterpret_cast` is only for casting void pointers really.

327765949,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-24T18:21:46Z,need a description
328247091,373,AnastaZIuk,2019-09-25T17:27:15Z,i will cover it soon
328248018,373,AnastaZIuk,2019-09-25T17:29:21Z,gonna cover it soon
328273646,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:24:47Z,clarify
328274807,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:27:23Z,because of external and custom asset loaders we cannot protect a static_cast with a type enum comparison.. this is why we provide a string.
328274947,373,AnastaZIuk,2019-09-25T18:27:41Z,"i think it's clear, isn't it?"
328276665,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:31:29Z,"not necessairly true. it may be desireable to have a cache of gpu objects associated with the cpu objects, while at the same time being able to get rid of the ram overhead for storage of such a cpu object. this function will get rid of as much memory as possible (including references to cpu objects it needs), the only thing that stays is just the pointer and the memory allocated for that pointer (whole class). after this operation we can treat the asset contents as invalid garbage. the default cpu to gpu object converter provided by the engine does this."

328279475,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:37:56Z,"and compared to `std::array` its size can be determined at runtime. as a consequence `sizeof(dynamic_array )` is completely meaningless, and it can only be allocated on the heap and is non-copyable."
328280212,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-09-25T18:39:26Z,"the purpose of this class is to compensate for the non-copyability of the base class and allow ""pass by reference"" (shared contents) without memory leaks and going out of scope."

328302568,373,AnastaZIuk,2019-09-25T19:34:25Z,"well, i will move it"

329916156,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-01T07:39:17Z,"replace ""arrays operations"" to array indexing"
329916909,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-01T07:41:23Z,"its actually necessary to reserve the correct amount of memory when writing to file, ""conservative"" here actually means that the value returned can be greater than memory actually needed. what you've written about is actually a secondary functionality, also, the bigger the asset the more likely it is to be compressed with a more expensive (slower) algorithm (replace the badly formed sentence ending)."
329917536,373,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-01T07:43:16Z,"its important to note that not every writer supports all these flags and may just silently drop them when writing (example, jpg, png do not write encrypted images)"

420663234,480,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-06T09:37:56Z,why add `effect` to the name

422015730,480,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-08T08:26:39Z,you could possibly load with an override that overrides the cache searching so you get a separate asset cache just for cegui (you'd also need to override the gpu object creator slightly for `getgpuobjectsfromassets`) cc:

352237707,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-29T20:14:21Z,"that's a distinction that only gli seems to make, in vulkan and modern (dsa) opengl, faces of a cubemap are layers `arraylayerindex%6` gives you the cubemap face `arraylayerindex/6` gives you the cubemap array index"
352237751,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-29T20:14:45Z,"well yeah, no point in duplicate loaders."
352237768,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-29T20:14:51Z,good.
352272486,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-30T08:03:43Z,what do you think about it?
352302094,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-30T20:10:11Z,"thanks to `gl_arb_texture_storage` we now deal with exclusively internal formats [a link] before opengl was a retarded mix of extenal+type format, i.e. `gl_rgba` + `gl_float` now you just have `gl_rgba32f` you should ignore swizzles and target types (well you still need to differentiate 1d, 2d and 3d) for images and put them in the imageview creation struct instead, arbitrary swizzles are possible."
352337738,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-01T11:29:42Z,"hm, actually it seems to me that our image assumes that the ""layer"" is always one, but if it is an cubemap it can handle some ""layers"" considered by our api as faces, right? so if there were some layers, i have to create pointers of our **icpuimage** and if target is an cubemap, i can set **arraylayers** that stores our faces"
352337875,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-01T11:32:18Z,"but in that case where there are loaded layers i have to consider mipmap level if present and create **screationparams** for each image, because it won't match anymore"
352378236,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-01T22:30:42Z,"only one icpuimage is ever produced, ""layers"" are no different than ""depth"" and function exactly like ""height"" pixel addressing. `((z*height+y)*width+x)*pixelsize` there's even a function that gets you an offset into a bufer buffer i believe. icpuimage consists of declaration of image size+format+etc plus a list of buffer regions that shall be copied into it, see the ""fixed"" png loader, separate mip-map levels are separate image subresources, hence a separate buffer-region to copy. you don't however need 1 buffer per copy region, you can pack everything into one without any problem (that's what offsets are for). see vulkan-tutorial and read documentation of `vkcmdcopybuffertoimage`"
352378352,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-01T22:32:40Z,why?
352378371,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-01T22:33:00Z,patent expired in 2019
352378404,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-01T22:33:41Z,"also decompression is patented, not transfer of bytes, sending compressed data stream to opengl driver puts the onus of licensing on opengl driver implementation not the application using opengl (this is why mesa can't have nice things)"
352378531,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-01T22:35:35Z,this sort of shit should be a cmake option then go into the buildconfig dynaically configured file. look at the first 6 files here [a link] if you want to you can convert all the other `_irr_compile_with` to cmake options.

353136301,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-03T11:56:51Z,yeah i don't remember all the structs and nested class declarations off by heart ;)
353935335,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-04T19:22:05Z,i think i've got it wrong while reading about copybuffers it seems to me that there should be one imageview and images in amount of mipmaps and such images will be filled by copy buffers to finaly create imageview i need to read it one more time for sure

353948945,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:51:01Z,just collapse this into the default case.
353949291,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:51:47Z,one image and one imageview there will be one copy range struct per mip-map (but it will point to 1 image and 1 buffer)
353949952,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:53:10Z,you need to vary `miplevel` and `bufferoffset` accordingly also are you sure gli will give tightly packed image rows?
353950328,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:53:55Z,"finally `extent` shrinks for each mip level, the icpuimage or iimage has a utlity function that actually tells you the extent of a given mip-level."
353950859,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:54:57Z,"this is stupid, `gl::swizzle` is an enum, you can just make an array and just index it by the swizzle"
353951503,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-04T19:56:21Z,you'll have to inver the swizzle for some of these

354411287,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-05T16:21:11Z,i'd assume that if gli reports `internal_bgra8_unorm` then rgba = bgra and then there's an extra swizzle from gli on top of that meaning that `internal_bgra8_unorm` needs to become `ef_r8g8b8a8_unorm` + a swizzle that is red = blue green = green blue = red alpha = alpha
354412093,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-05T16:22:38Z,what is this last comment about!?
354413869,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-05T16:25:35Z,"but that's what my mapping does, it respects it otherwise why does gli read swizzle on 4 size vector?"
354424775,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-05T16:44:17Z,well but what happens if you have the bgra format + a custom swizzle? or will gli not give you such?
354526276,402,AnastaZIuk,2019-12-05T20:16:25Z,"the default is `rgba`, without swizzle assumption standard swizzle vector with size of 4 also assume that it is `rgba` and it returns enum swizze to each chanel r as [0], g as [1] and so forth i think. in that case, if my format in case statement matches `bgra` format, we will have to consider that format is got from texture contating loaded parameters, swizzles though. mapped swizzles (without mapping extraordinary to our api) are in format order therefore, right? for instance: format[4] (where there is r, g, b, a default) read swizzle on [0] (`r`), gli returns on it swizzle_blue, so i map it and get 'b' read swizzle on [1] (`g`), gli returns on it swizzle_green, so i map it and get 'g' read swizzle on [2] (`b`), gli returns on it swizzle_red, so i map it and get 'r' read swizzle on [3] (`a`), gli returns on it swizzle_alpha, so i map it and get 'a' swizzle output -> `bgra` and there is mapping to our api left i have to handle it, right"
354562954,402,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-05T21:44:44Z,"just test and see what assumptions are correct, i know nothing about how gli works, only our library."

392579310,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-14T11:49:22Z,"first of all use `fittingvector` not `normal`, we save space by noting the symmetry and using a `abs(normal)` for the fitting and caching (after fit is found or computed the function should restore the signs). should be applied to the search result too now [a link] you want to take the `fittingvector` and transform it into a 2d surface projection `projfitting` my suggestion is barycentric coordinate of the intersection of a line originating at (0,0,0) in direction of `fittingvector` with the triangle defined by vertices (0,0,1),(0,1,0),(1,0,0)"

395764229,437,Przemog1,2020-03-20T16:48:01Z,.. right
396360487,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-23T10:48:20Z,just remove these cases and let them drop to default.
396370927,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-23T11:07:11Z,and remove the enums from here [a link]
396830110,437,Przemog1,2020-03-24T00:01:43Z,i wonder if i should make these static

396961301,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-24T08:01:33Z,actually take an `sbufferbinding` its because it would be handy to support an offset into the buffer from which to read.
396961496,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-24T08:01:55Z,this is still an issue
396963372,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-24T08:05:50Z,keep these structs in `cquantnormalcache` don't want them to pollute the global namespace

397091240,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-24T11:46:10Z,there should be a requirement that the input to this function already be a an absolute value vector
397091547,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-24T11:46:43Z,because `bestfit` returned will be an abs value vector

399115441,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T08:53:42Z,you can put it next to `sbufferbinding`
399116001,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T08:54:44Z,this should be a method of the `cquantnormalcache` not its owner.
399130463,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T09:21:18Z,still
399136863,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-27T09:32:19Z,and these should also be methods of `cquantnormalcache`
399646749,437,Przemog1,2020-03-28T10:33:03Z,is it ok?
399650667,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-28T11:18:34Z,just plain old pointer and non-static member function
399650703,437,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-28T11:18:55Z,stop with the statics!
399651358,437,Przemog1,2020-03-28T11:26:31Z,that will complicate things but ok

310355900,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:02:29Z,"if you register loader with asset manager, you can just load by path"
310356433,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:22:59Z,looks like a candidate for a static function ?
310356437,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:23:15Z,why do you need to track the type?
310356755,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:39:32Z,`parserlog::mitsubaloadererror` what's this?
310356772,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:40:02Z,explain?
310356797,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:40:59Z,override + final
310356905,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:45:27Z,shouldn't it always be `_atts[2]==nullptr` and `_atts[0] && _atts[1]` ?
310356946,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:47:13Z,ok if you're going to use `new` that heavily just spawn a context for the current loading session (like in baw file loader) and give that context a linear allocator to use to do placement-new
310356975,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T16:48:35Z,or do you seriously need to implement the simple element stuff to dynamically create `ielement`s ?
310357772,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T17:19:08Z,i dont think i will need that anywhere else
310358031,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:30:29Z,"if it does not need the internal state of an object (does not need `this`) if should always be a static. bonus point, you can have a private static."
310358043,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T17:31:08Z,"to make downcasting easier, i do a lot of downcasting, especially in processchilddata functions. just like in this example: [a link]"
310358102,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:32:53Z,"but matrix is always 4x4 or 3x4 (with implicit 0,0,0,1 last row). this is matrix type not element type!"
310358403,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T17:43:20Z,"it just prints ""mitsuba loader error:\ninvalid .xml file structure: '"" followed by its only parameter `errormessage`: [a link] i think it needs better name and also i will use there `printer::log` instead of `printer::print`"
310358445,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:45:08Z,so if you have `celementmatrix` why do you keep a separate transform here?
310358464,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:45:50Z,ok i see this as todo
310358475,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:46:18Z,use smart pointer
310358628,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:53:18Z,"you're gonna be wanting to be using a variant of this one [a link] hierarchy is as follows: - 0 for root level asset (an icpumesh for now, we have no scene object) - 1 for whatever icpumesh contains, so meshbuffers so the hierarchy would be 0u, 1u in the future if we make an icpuscene object or something like that."
310358655,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T17:54:42Z,your include paths on extension headers are all wrong... see rule nr. 5 in the readme [a link]
310359116,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T18:12:54Z,"if .xml file structure is correct, then _atts[0] is always ""value"" and _atts[1] is a string consisting of 16 floats"
310359214,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T18:18:12Z,parserutil.cpp less inline functions
310359316,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T18:22:51Z,it is not implemented yet
310359325,340,Przemog1,2019-08-03T18:23:23Z,"sorry, i should leave some comment about that"
310359904,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T18:45:00Z,yes
310359963,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-03T18:47:06Z,"but still, explain?"
310366655,340,Crisspl,2019-08-04T00:53:38Z,where this rule come from actually?
310381788,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-04T10:59:24Z,"the justification is that the extension should not fuck-up your build system because you didn't add its directory to the search path. imagine that your project includes extension files, but extension files include their peers with relative paths, you're gonna have a fuck-up when two extensions have the same public include filenames, unless full paths relative to repo's `./include/` are specified"
314891868,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:13:06Z,"there's a thing called valiation, someone might be trying to feed the loader a bad .xml and the loader should not crash because of that"
314892242,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:14:25Z,what did we agree on in the end?
314892306,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:14:37Z,you should be using the overload!
314896456,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:29:52Z,what about alpha?
314896623,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:30:31Z,explain?
314897985,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:35:23Z,why?
314898996,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:39:27Z,no need if going to provide metadata
314899015,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-16T21:39:34Z,use smart pointer?
315012808,340,Przemog1,2019-08-19T01:09:36Z,"needed that for ""baking"" mesh transforms, but it is irrelevant now"
316682812,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-22T13:39:22Z,what's happened here?
316684051,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-22T13:41:50Z,and you know that there's a `core::make_smart_refctd_ptr` so you don't need to use the nasty `dont_grab` constructor
316685295,340,Przemog1,2019-08-22T13:44:09Z,"it is probably because i copied and pasted entire code from my ""backup file"""
317288569,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-23T20:21:13Z,what are you doing here?
317288975,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-23T20:22:35Z,"the convention here is to return the raw pointer, we only want to return a `smart_refctd_ptr` if we are sure that the callee wants to hold onto the reference for a longer time."
317310594,340,Przemog1,2019-08-23T21:39:12Z,here i retrive mesh from shape element
317310832,340,Przemog1,2019-08-23T21:40:10Z,then this retrived mesh is added to the array which contain all loaded meshes
317325602,340,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-08-23T22:57:23Z,i meant ref-counting-wise?
339260993,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T22:34:36Z,you only want to be loading `.glsl` files
339263104,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T22:46:04Z,try rendering an attribute-less mesh (like in vulkan examples) move the `vertices` array to the vertex shader and index it with `gl_vertexid` all this code is overkill for splatting points accoridng to a bsdf
339263251,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T22:46:41Z,"if you set `eit_unknown` then you can create a mesh without index buffer, index-count becomes vertex count"
339263358,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T22:47:14Z,you need `layout(location = 0)` for this
339263399,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T22:47:28Z,we use `#version 430 core`
339292272,390,achalpandeyy,2019-10-26T08:37:21Z,"as mentioned in the comment above, this was just to test if the custom shaders are working as intended. it will not make it to the final version."
339292349,390,achalpandeyy,2019-10-26T08:38:46Z,same as above.
339307382,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-26T16:54:07Z,"you could use a `smart_refctd_ptr` you know, if only `irr::shadermanager` inherited from `irr::core::referencecounted`"
339307405,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-26T16:54:44Z,you might want to check for shader compile fail.
339307455,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-26T16:55:54Z,do not put random example class in my engine's namespaces!
339307468,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-26T16:56:04Z,do not put random example class in my engine's namespaces!
339307522,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-26T16:57:58Z,i'm thinking that maybe bsdf_cos_sample should return both the chosen direction and probability (might be less intensive to compute them together) and abandon the `bsdf_cos_sample_probability` function
339327665,390,achalpandeyy,2019-10-27T07:00:11Z,"yeah, this was something i was kind of confused about. why do we put `bsdfvalidatorapp` in `irr` namespace, then? i observed similar behavior in the brdf explorer."
339329266,390,achalpandeyy,2019-10-27T07:47:06Z,isn't it already done deep within `copengldriver::addhighlevelshadermaterial` somewhere in `source/irrlicht/copenglslmaterialrenderer.cpp` ? i was getting compile errors when i appended illegal function definitions to the shader. is it worth doing it again?
339331612,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T08:49:00Z,because i (unfortunately) wansn't babysitting the person who wrote it.
339331701,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T08:51:10Z,if `copengldriver::addhighlevelshadermaterial` returns <0 then the shader failed to build.
339333905,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T09:49:25Z,you can still do `using namespace irr;` in c++ files
339333911,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T09:49:34Z,and `using namespace irr::ext::cegui;`
339333955,390,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T09:50:46Z,"you will probably want to display the buttons/ui not over the texture, so you need a larger window"
233016775,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:27:35Z,you may as well allow for start+end colors... also why require uint8_normalized color format? just let people use full floats for rgba
233017001,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:28:22Z,i'd call the extensions something more useful.. maybe `debugdraw`
233017523,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:30:15Z,if you're going to draw lines i'd pass 2 instead of 3... but this is only cosmetic since that parameter is only needed for tessellation shaders.
233018069,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:32:16Z,"if your index buffer is going to be 0,1, ... (starting at some offset and then monotonically increasing by 1) then there is no need for it"
233018335,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:33:12Z,you can actually drop the descriptor straight after line 59 since meshbuffer will grab
233019202,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:36:14Z,ect_unsigned_int is not normalized format... you need normalized format i think like `ect_normalized_unsigned_int` non nomralized int formats are for shaders that take `ivecn` or `uvecn` as inputs
233019629,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:37:40Z,`m_linedata` needs not be a class member
233019925,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:38:32Z,will change to float color
233019956,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:38:40Z,most of this set-up you can do in the constructor
233020099,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:39:14Z,changed it anyways
233020313,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:39:57Z,updated
233020376,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T12:40:12Z,"if there is no `smgr->drawall` or at least `smgr->onanimate` then the active camera will not be updated, and hence you will get no change in the view-proj matrix and ergo your line won't move"
233022671,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:47:29Z,for multi-threading capability ... right.
233023153,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:49:10Z,then m_offsets should not be a member either
233024018,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:51:56Z,so i can just remove all index related calls?
233024598,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:54:03Z,including `mapvertexattrbuffer`? you mean i can even `multi_place` in constructor to get mem offset then update the buffer for each `cdraw3dline::draw` call?
233024888,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T12:54:59Z,added smgr->drawall()
233028099,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T13:04:30Z,"you should never use the default streaming buffer persistently... so allocate and free on each draw. if one uses streaming buffer persistently, then streaming buffer is no longer a streaming buffer. however you can set `basevertex` on the mesh dynamically! (which is why you want/need allocation alignment to be a multiple of vertex size )"
233028429,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T13:05:25Z,"not for mt capability, it just simply doesn't need to be kept around outside of the function. for mt its best to create one instance per-thread and use these independently..."
233028491,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T13:05:37Z,pretty much.
233028937,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T13:06:58Z,if getting rid of indices then set this to eit_unknown

233061900,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T14:36:15Z,index count still needs to be present... it tells how many vertices are to be drawn.
233107681,172,manhnt9,2018-11-13T16:04:35Z,"i think it's not necessarily used for debug, sometimes you want lines in the world for some reason. and in the future someone may add more drawing extension."
233136801,172,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-13T17:05:40Z,a. this is not a high performance implementation of line drawing b. why is the extension called `draw` if it only draws lines?
233306299,172,manhnt9,2018-11-14T03:47:11Z,changed namespace to debugdraw
413863210,478,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-23T14:49:54Z,probably not
413864795,478,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-23T14:51:42Z,you want the same treatment on c and cxx flags (except for __cplusplus macro)
413865356,478,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-23T14:52:23Z,you need to handle c (non cxx) as well
413866088,478,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-23T14:53:13Z,like making the o2 replace disappear

413874720,478,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-23T15:02:59Z,and you don't want any `/z` (`/zi`) option on a release build since its pointless

170436031,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-24T23:25:15Z,what you use now for textures should really be ect_texture_paths although ect_textures should already be reserved
170436903,39,Crisspl,2018-02-25T00:07:43Z,"it was done quite a long ago due to mem-leaks patching. irrlicht's reference counted objects has to be dropped after setting them as other object 'ownership'. e.g.: [code block] here before `desc` goes out of scope it has to dropped so that when meshbuffer is being destroyed, `desc`'s refcount will be ==1 and meshbuffer's destructor will actually destroy it. but it must be done after *all* such sets (since one object can be 'owned' more then once but drop must be only one) and above applies only for reference counted objects and not even all of them... so `regulardrop` is called after all the loading. what's more.. we want to support any kind of blobs so we have to assume `releaseobj` will not do just drop but actual `delete`. that's what i was talking about while whining about this reference-counting irrlicht's thing and not some kind of `unique_ptr`."
170437649,39,Crisspl,2018-02-25T00:47:17Z,without this there'll be even more repeating (explicitly passing treshold values to writing function). besides.. i don't really see repeating in this.

170450760,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-25T12:02:14Z,but why do you call releaseobj only on some blobs?
170450782,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-25T12:02:59Z,you have one lzmamemmngmnt for write and one lzmamemmngmnt for load ? should't this be in typedblob or cbawfile?

170452700,39,Crisspl,2018-02-25T13:17:57Z,"because not all of our ref-counted objects has to be dropped (i.e. mesh through the whole loading time has ref-count==1 because no other object grabs it) and also, in case of non-reference-counted objects releaseobj would call just `delete` and we don't want it. there's just a finite set of objects that must be dropped and infinite set of possible blobs so..."
170465631,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-25T20:18:56Z,"createmesh is designed to only ever return one mesh... so thats the only thing not getting deleted. loaded textures upon gettexture are added to the ivideodriver texture cache and can neither be dropped or deleted, removetexture must be called upon them... and i'm totally fine with cache pollution from unreferenced textures. since we have infinite set of possible blobs, every single one should have releaseobj called except for the top blobs being returned (like the root blob that we started loading). anything thats not being returned implicitly or explicitly by load routines should get destoroyed, because thats the very definition of a memory leak."

171078072,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-27T21:49:31Z,shouldn't the function return outsize or at least write it to _outsize ?
171078250,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-27T21:50:10Z,why are you creating an encrypted file by default?
171078937,39,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-27T21:52:39Z,no.... just check against the specific blob header's data you are returning (make the function take the createobjs iterator of the blob that you chose as the mesh to load)

167842180,36,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-02-13T11:57:50Z,"this is a general function present in all our video namespace objects which reference/use resizeable resources such as textures and buffers. arb_buffer_storage and arb_texture_storage remove the ability to respecify storage for opengl objects (essentially no gpu realloc) so to resize objects we need to destroy the old and create a new object, this means that the opengl handles (object ids) change so the new object needs to be bound in place of the old (texture to an fbo, buffer to a vao). whenever a bound object gets modified this way an atomic counter increases and this triggers the rebind* function to do more than just return `true`. the driver always calls these functions internally before using the object with a rebind*() function. however for the framebuffer you can call it manually after changing attachments as it will also call `glcheckframebufferstatus` which will make the rebindrevalidate() function return false if the color formats you are trying to render to are invalid (like rgb9_e5) or if a certain combination of attachments is invalid (try specifying the depth and stencil attachments to be different with any nvidia gpu). this function does nothing if no changes to bound objects have occurred."

344234999,399,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-08T15:41:02Z,"actuallly i don't get it technically. i mean, won't there be a maximum value of `int8_t` if i casted `double` to `int8_t` assuming my double variable is around 100k? won't it be clamped automaticaly even though?"
344256778,399,Crisspl,2019-11-08T16:25:20Z,"nah, it's ub. see [a link], paragraph 4.9.1. however on gcc indeed there is a clamp [a link] but ofc you cannot rely on behavior of single compiler since standard says that anything really can happen (just as well it could be wrap-around did in some tricky way or some random shit)"
344258104,399,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-08T16:28:08Z,"thank you so much, i'm gonna check it!"
344356380,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-08T20:36:09Z,wrong range... maybe make a template intermediate function calling `core::clamp` that will deduce the limits from integer type?
344356526,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-08T20:36:38Z,don't touch these functions in `decode`
347090520,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-16T12:56:09Z,don't we have this function already in terms of `e_format` ?
347090566,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-16T12:57:24Z,input is always a `double` you can take away the boolean argument we have a function that is a template of `e_format` i believe its called `isformatnormalized ()` or something like that.
347090606,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-16T12:58:36Z,"its actually the other way round... the normalized gets a multiply up, the scaled stays as is reason is that normalized store the floating point [0,1] or [-1,1] range in all the ints, scaled just casts a float to an int."
347245783,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T08:22:17Z,make format a template parameter.
347246130,399,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T08:23:18Z,shouldn't this all be constexpr + constexpr function instead of reference?

347394186,399,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-18T13:58:07Z,is it a good practice or it goes on performance or you want it to be as you said just simply?

386275321,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-02T09:22:56Z,add an alias `irr/builtin/loaders/ply/pipelinelayout` (you can cache under multiple paths)
386466937,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-02T15:36:38Z,because we have tested it with criss and didn't work without it
386467060,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-02T15:36:49Z,okay

386467938,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-02T15:38:31Z,okay
386499721,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-02T16:25:19Z,that means that you have your polygons the wrong way around
386499934,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-02T16:25:39Z,they don't need a texture declared
387000211,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-03T12:55:28Z,they are correct after the fix however
387107026,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-03T15:42:08Z,"uv debug shader should not be using a texture, it should be outputting the uv coords as color!"
387107387,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-03T15:42:41Z,none of the default shaders ply uses for its pipelines can use a texture! (because it will never load a texture)
387107681,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-03T15:43:05Z,return type of function still not changed

387130978,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-03T16:16:06Z,hey i fixed it!
387492820,425,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-04T07:41:25Z,you still have a drop
387523551,425,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-04T08:53:14Z,goood
185475338,81,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-02T12:14:31Z,will this cmake let me specify custom openssl path? (so i dont compile and link against my system libs) like this? [a link]
185541307,81,numberZero,2018-05-02T15:36:57Z,"yes, but note that `openssl_libraries` is not a valid configuration option; use `openssl_crypto_library` (`-dopenssl_crypto_library=/path/to/crypto.so`) and `openssl_ssl_library` instead. `cmake-gui` shows the available configuration options (in terminal, use `cmake -lah ` instead)"
185561851,81,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-02T16:41:27Z,what about where it will get include files for openssl from?
185611051,81,numberZero,2018-05-02T19:25:42Z,"from `openssl_include_dir`. on my system, that’s just `/usr/include` by default, so that you can write e.g. `openssl/aes.h` to reference `/usr/include/openssl/aes.h`. that’s the way libraries are used with cmake."
339189360,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T18:42:44Z,i guess you can write `class final` and remove all the `virtual` keywords from the methods
339189905,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T18:44:12Z,this is going to crash badly. you need `.get()->getpointer()`
339190325,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T18:45:25Z,nope `if (_params.loaderflags&e_loader_parameter_flags::elpf_right_handed_meshes)`
339190810,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T18:46:36Z,why are you flipping around .z and not .x ?
339191401,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-25T18:48:12Z,stl is completely non indexed?
339198927,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-25T19:08:30Z,it seems it is non indexed
339335217,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T10:21:47Z,should _params be a const& member or should it be passed through functions?
339336864,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T11:07:21Z,and which one do you think will crash if you attempt to call the loader from multiple threads?
339336963,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T11:09:45Z,"where's your flip of the position and the normal around the x axis? also you shouldn't be inverting indices here, you'll end up premuting them twice... you'll get the same output as a result when rendering."
339338995,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T12:03:29Z,"oh right, i forgot about normals flip and did premuting twice actually"
339339089,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T12:05:47Z,"there is a pos flip, but sure, rest to fix"
339339123,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T12:06:35Z,"being honest i don't know, i haven't done anything with multithreading before"
339340679,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T12:41:19Z,"you're permuting the indices, and then you're permuting how normals and positions are read according to the indices... two reversals of indices == no reversal"
339345744,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T14:29:59Z,"well if you have a member and the loader is shared between threads, what's gonna happen?"
339346133,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T14:38:03Z,"i think that operations on such a member won't be atomic, right? so it could crash"
339346415,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T14:45:12Z,"well done, now you know why every loader has a context struct and passes a reference to it as a parameter.... rule nr. 1 of multi-threading, avoid global states."
339346591,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T14:48:47Z,"[a link] there is only one index mirrowing (last commit i removed double permuting), normals (added in last) and possitions are flipped as well"
339347167,389,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-27T15:00:10Z,where are the positions?
339348005,389,AnastaZIuk,2019-10-27T15:14:37Z,here there are my boss! [a link] positions [a link] normals [a link] indicies
181593508,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-15T19:12:51Z,at least normalize it before doing stuff with it! (all library functions will assume normalized quaternion input in order to be faster)
181593824,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-15T19:23:04Z,instead of nonsse float to double loadu there are instructions to promote the lower half of the register to double such as _mm_cvtps_pd p.s. most probably need 1 more instruction for the higher part of the register to move it down for bool _0=true
181593916,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-15T19:26:15Z,there's cvtpd_ps for parallel double to float conversion add a shuffle or movelh and you can put two registers made from double conversion into 1 register
181654357,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T08:18:32Z,a single shuffle_ps could do the work of or+and+movehl [a link]
181654518,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T08:19:09Z,this is beautiful
181655787,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T08:24:15Z,why so many core::transpose4 ?
181656227,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T08:25:45Z,"this will crash, vectorsimdf has a memory alignmend requirement of 16 bytes, plus you can't guarantee _out is 16 byte aligned in the first place"
181656857,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T08:28:10Z,could you explain the shuffles to me?
181689329,63,Crisspl,2018-04-16T10:30:59Z,"similarly to float32 version. `_a0` and `_a1` are two halves of a row. so: * `_mm_shuffle_pd(_a0, _a0, 0)` will give us first element of first half broadcasted (i.e. x brodcasted) * `_mm_shuffle_pd(_a0, _a0, 3)` will give us second element of first half broadcasted (y broadcasted). `3` comes from the fact that 3==0b11 same for second half. the trailing `if` is because in first half it'd have no sense since first half of 3rd row is {0, 0} and so we would have to do something like _mm_add_pd(res, _mm_and_pd(_a1, **mask00**));"
181699716,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T11:17:16Z,"don't add this, make quaternion oblivious of matrix3x4simd you can reinterpret_cast quaternion to vectorsimdf very safely"
181700113,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-16T11:19:18Z,i was just confused as to the 0b11 shuffle mask for a shuffle_pd [a link]
181733876,63,Crisspl,2018-04-16T13:30:43Z,tested it. works
182711082,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-19T11:10:21Z,with 3 hadds this will go in the res[3] element which will never be memcopied out... as this is the non 4x1 function maybe for this specific instance (mul with 3x1 vector) you should use the default zero vector for r3
182717665,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-19T11:42:14Z,"there's no fast way to insert a custom translation into a row matrix, so we must do it simply in non-simd fashion (you could do two transposes but thats simply slower). there's no need for a transpose so multiply all rows by center to obtain `r_i = ri*_center` then use 3 hadds to reduce the 3 rows (and a random register) into a single 4x1 vector `col3` then get `finalcol3 = _center-_translation-col3` you can then save the 3 out of 4 components of finalcol3 to elements 3,7,11 of the matrix with regular c memory ops"
182717738,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-19T11:42:42Z,there's no need for the mask as the final component doesn't get saved as there is no row[3]
182718005,63,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-04-19T11:44:09Z,"this is wrong, it should have been `-c0*_center.x-c1*_center.y-c2*_center.z`"
346540097,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-14T20:53:01Z,"pitch, i think in bytes"
346540806,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-14T20:54:32Z,"see how address is calculated in vk, if this is 0 then its assumed to be tightly packed."
346543626,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-14T21:01:13Z,"actually not in bytes. but you should aim for it to be image width rounded up to the next ""lowest common multiple of 8 and texel block byte size"" after ""texel block byte size times image width"" basically [code block]"
346544013,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-14T21:02:13Z,`(region.bufferrowlength*blockbytesize)` instead
346544240,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-14T21:02:54Z,you've already moved the `texelbuffer` you will crash on nullptr
347247538,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T08:27:21Z,"no this is wrong, you're not taking level into account!"
347247859,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T08:28:20Z,i removed this function for a reason!
347248257,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T08:29:29Z,and you `region.bufferrowlength` is still 0
347286283,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T09:56:48Z,actually its fine.
347289026,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T10:01:47Z,removed.
347291755,400,Crisspl,2019-11-18T10:07:17Z,"i added it temporarily because i needed to perform core::max on this type just for when _mm_cmplt/gt are broken. see commit previous to last one, i replaced vector3simd for vector3d, somewhere in iimage i think"
347299417,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T10:22:54Z,fixing the compile issue now.
347304538,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T10:33:01Z,"changed to a macro in vectorsimdf, works now"
347304601,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T10:33:09Z,fixed it myself.
347304761,400,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-18T10:33:31Z,"had to change it a bit, realized this wont work"
357872190,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:40:16Z,you will only create one icpuimage (previous system was fucked up thats why the api was changed). the icpuimage contains all mip-maps (but here you will only have one mip).
357872324,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:40:57Z,"well you're falling through your switch statement, so all non-rgba format images will try to load with wrong format."
357872744,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:43:23Z,"you can create the icpu buffer first, and use it instead of `data`"
357872863,406,Przemog1,2019-12-13T23:44:03Z,"i know, but it is for testing purpose, so far i'm trying to load only rgba image"
357872865,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:44:04Z,"this will leak (double grab), use `auto imagebuffer = core::make_smart_refctd_ptr (imagesize);` instead"
357873116,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:45:26Z,"all of the above are good, you just need to pick the format correctly."
357873177,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:45:47Z,no need for a `.get()` the `->` operator is already overloaded.
357873280,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:46:32Z,"ok dude, you need to fill out `regions` with apropriate values, you have uninitialized memory there right now"
357873487,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-13T23:47:43Z,you can delete this variable actually.
357873492,406,Przemog1,2019-12-13T23:47:45Z,right
358139907,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-12-16T09:55:56Z,"this format is not supported widely, this is why i had a function here originally that would convert r8_srgb to rgb8_srgb in software."
366565355,406,AnastaZIuk,2020-01-14T20:50:08Z,in that should i calculate average of channels and perform grayscale or should i fill `g` and `b` channels with certain default values like 0?
366571552,406,AnastaZIuk,2020-01-14T21:05:07Z,"i see we have someting like `video::convertcolor`, but i'm not sure if it'll solve it though"
366575753,406,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-01-14T21:15:23Z,no what imean is that you should duplicare the r8_srgb channel to fill rgb8_srgb so its basically is: [code block]
366576349,406,AnastaZIuk,2020-01-14T21:16:47Z,"okay, great"
480280796,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T17:33:59Z,what happened here!?
480280849,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T17:34:03Z,what happened here!?
480283319,534,Crisspl,2020-08-31T17:38:34Z,"instance.parent is always shapehroup by mitsuba docs which doesnt have tform so it makes no sense. i dont know how it worked, i did it in a way more understadnable for me"

480285143,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T17:41:57Z,wouldn't it make more sense to store just one offset and 3 counts?

480290629,534,Crisspl,2020-08-31T17:52:09Z,why not
480314049,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T18:36:00Z,could this be a template parameter instead (compile time)?
480345468,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T19:24:32Z,any way to disable this function at compile time if `!has_derivative` ? i'm not an `enable_if` expert unfortunately.

480354791,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T19:35:21Z,where is `scale` and `havescale` (who declares it) ?
480355133,534,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-31T19:36:05Z,hmmm the constructors should just take the r-value kernels and work out the negative and positive support (in all 3 dimensions) as the maximum of all kernel's supports.
480359597,534,Crisspl,2020-08-31T19:45:15Z,"yeah, all streams for one ir tree are put in continuous memory anyway so it can be done without an issue"

271620205,250,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-03T08:02:04Z,excise this and the comment completely
271620647,250,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-03T08:03:10Z,replace `params.handlesrgb` with `true` entirely
271682644,250,Crisspl,2019-04-03T10:48:16Z,the rest is taken care of or not supported in gl all we have is slightly renamed vkformat. ofc it doesn't mean they are supported in gl

271714581,250,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-03T12:24:08Z,any questions?

411673761,473,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-20T20:35:05Z,its probably being unused where its being called.
411673839,473,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-04-20T20:35:12Z,so why the cast?
411678612,473,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-20T20:43:19Z,"yes, i wanted to use attribute to avoid it"
411678772,473,AnastaZIuk,2020-04-20T20:43:35Z,to fix

391790319,436,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-12T17:47:25Z,no display

392232890,436,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-13T13:39:45Z,afaik nonlinear srgb will only be the case for non-floating point image format (image depth 8 bit or less) float16 or higher will be linear srgb without an eotf (linear eotf)
392233115,436,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-13T13:40:14Z,name is something exr specific etc.
392588838,436,AnastaZIuk,2020-03-14T13:34:22Z,what do you mean?
392589548,436,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-14T13:45:41Z,if its linear then the eotf_ is literally nothing
392589620,436,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-03-14T13:46:24Z,"add a `eotf_identity` to the list (pass through, no transformation of inputs occurs)"

278430811,271,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-25T07:48:07Z,i think this may fail if the output directory is not present there yet
278431403,271,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-25T07:49:58Z,why did you remove this?
278432189,271,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-04-25T07:52:17Z,"a. why are you using `force` all over the place? b. all of the subfolders specify the things with `option` not `set`, why are you using `set` ?"
278432365,271,manhnt9,2019-04-25T07:52:49Z,the folder is guaranteed by the submodule (this is a verified fix by criss and shaderc's devs). still a dirty work-around though but it's out of my support scope anyways.
278432443,271,manhnt9,2019-04-25T07:53:03Z,explained in other issue
278432663,271,manhnt9,2019-04-25T07:53:42Z,here: [a link]
278433110,271,manhnt9,2019-04-25T07:55:06Z,using `force` so cmake overwrite current settings and people don't need to clear build folder and run cmake again. a minor issue though.
336540984,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T15:11:49Z,"not like this, look at [a link]"
336541831,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T15:13:39Z,if you did [a link] then we wouldn't need this `#ifdef` clutter
336543143,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T15:16:35Z,"if you want to support 1d,2d array textures or cubemaps you need to call this something else, and touch index 1 or 2 so you have the correct 3d extent"
336544406,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T15:19:23Z,i suggest to rename it to `minoffset`
336544776,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-18T15:20:10Z,you need to do [code block] then everything shall work

337404608,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-22T09:10:29Z,ktx and dds would be nice.
337404833,381,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-10-22T09:10:54Z,would be good to load dds as well since gli does both (and you could get rid of our awful dds loader).
185208710,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-01T12:03:31Z,whats going on here? why would createmeshbufferduplicate give a null meshdataandformat if _inbuffer has a non null one ?
185208979,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-01T12:06:44Z,there's an sgpumesh for such operations on an igpumesh should there be an scpumesh derived from icpumesh too? (if one wants to add and remove meshbuffers)
185209139,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-01T12:08:13Z,"don't add mutability to icpumesh api, if you have code that requires mutability and manipulation then create an scpumesh (or skinned mesh) and cast it when you're done"
185209261,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-01T12:09:35Z,ccpuskinnedmesh should only contain scpuskinmeshbuffers!
185327755,80,Crisspl,2018-05-01T20:40:10Z,and there's appropriate dynamic_cast
185331642,80,Crisspl,2018-05-01T20:55:47Z,but how you know that _inbuffer has a non null one?
186552886,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-07T21:11:58Z,"you took away my unordered_set optimization it seems edit: checked the rest, it seems you didn't but you changed my include files :)"

186553376,80,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-05-07T21:13:55Z,rename to denormalized for consistency
283866246,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-14T15:36:39Z,spit out the profiling only in `_irr_debug` if defined

283868908,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-14T15:41:35Z,instead of epsilon i want a `std::function` vertex comparison predicate
283870151,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-14T15:44:05Z,this is 100% correct ;)
283870569,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-14T15:44:57Z,you know you could just use a std::vertex::resize instead of a reserve+emplace loop
286832703,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-23T08:34:34Z,"this needs to be an actual `assert(!core::ispot(_hashtablemaxsize))`, we want the program to crash (with a message) `_irr_debug_break_if` only breaks the debugger if one is used, otherwise execution continues."
286835874,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-23T08:42:27Z,maybe take heed from [a link] because the mesh does not always need to be created as a duplicate (in-fact that can be harmful to other optimizations).
286836094,297,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-23T08:43:00Z,you also need to check whether the index type is `eit_unknown` (that the mesh has no shared vertices)
502294384,539,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-09T09:10:15Z,change the theshold to `(0x1<<coalescing_dwords_log2)` also does changing the `coalescing_dwords_log2` to 5 and deleting the `notenoughinvocations` (always false) change the perf of the benchmark much?
502295127,539,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-10-09T09:11:29Z,"wonder if we hoisted the `bonedata_dword retval` above the if, and had only one ssbo with the `restrict` keyword, how the perf would change then (both branches do `tobonedata`"

478579218,531,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-27T17:25:18Z,why not `alloc` all at once?
478579349,531,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-27T17:25:32Z,why not `commit` all at once?
478581296,531,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-27T17:28:56Z,why?
478581976,531,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-27T17:30:04Z,move this below `camera->render()`
478582469,531,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-27T17:30:54Z,this is going to be a problem

344511522,398,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-10T19:55:01Z,"well, how should it look like? do you mean a static method expecting two lambdas for handling orientation?"
344714999,398,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-11T13:40:49Z,"i mean, if there should be such a method, it should have access to `_params`. should i create a pointer to it as a member? how would you like it to look like?"
344730426,398,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-11T14:17:09Z,how should i apply flipping on baw loader exactly?
345335150,398,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-11-12T17:13:57Z,are there still questions?
345375327,398,AnastaZIuk,2019-11-12T18:36:48Z,it's been valid still
425650789,489,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-05-15T08:36:11Z,do the `load` and `dump` actually get called without polymorphism?
425675833,489,Przemog1,2020-05-15T09:21:14Z,"yup, check out parameters of `load` and `dump` functions [a link]"

173875713,48,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-03-12T17:13:07Z,this may need both acquire and release

260376476,219,khomsidakhun,2019-02-26T16:38:30Z,i'd assume it won't spew errors and you'd be able to do without but just to be safe i'll add some sanity checks if they leave it blank and not glob_recurse over a blank string
288491740,219,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-05-29T10:10:08Z,now your bullet lib needs to come from the submodule

461202065,522,Crisspl,2020-07-27T22:16:54Z,"thats why its in subdir for glsl backend that would imply scattering material_compiler sources over language/backend-based directories like glsl/material_compiler, backendx/material_compiler, backendy/material_compiler etc"

269774654,249,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-03-27T21:18:25Z,what are you doing? i said log the metadata... i.e. the png header!
269774949,249,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-03-27T21:19:14Z,check the gamma ( jpeg has different color profiles)

474168127,529,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-20T17:52:35Z,this worries me
474660738,529,AnastaZIuk,2020-08-21T12:19:06Z,it's because `readblockpos` if filled with `localcoord+trueoffset` and some line earlier there is the statement `trueoffset.w = subresource.basearraylayer;`
474660982,529,AnastaZIuk,2020-08-21T12:19:36Z,corrected
475111289,529,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-08-22T17:18:17Z,ok makes sense.
234402401,181,devshgraphicsprogramming,2018-11-17T09:24:21Z,should that be a vector of std::pair ?

294235784,328,devshgraphicsprogramming,2019-06-17T10:35:41Z,we don't need any of the non-virtual functions

460003961,520,Crisspl,2020-07-24T11:46:26Z,i'd move this to icomputepipeline.h or make separate utility header and move all 3 there
460004377,520,Crisspl,2020-07-24T11:47:23Z,probably separate header is best option
460061262,520,Przemog1,2020-07-24T13:45:04Z,what do you think?
460354435,520,devshgraphicsprogramming,2020-07-25T02:42:39Z,"i second criss, this (all indirect structs) should move to `irr/asset/ipipeline.h`"

258016649,222,Crisspl,2019-02-19T12:26:07Z,just using the adopting constructor but as you can see it allocates its own mem. however it's missing memcpy
