linuxmint/cinnamon,reviews,211582946,8428,"hi , i was seeing if i could test this with cinnamenu, and it appears to only show the desktop wallpaper. i'm applying this to the `popup-menu-content` class (only one that seemed to show the bump map), and opacifying every actor underneath. ![a link] i'm also concerned about performance. my initial impression with no effects applied to css is performance is regressing and window rendering becomes further out of sync with the cursor. this is noticeable for me on my xeon/nvidia desktop i do most benchmarking on. i am applying this on top of master + linuxmint/muffin#410 + linuxmint/muffin#397 + #8269 + #8300. at least the first issue might be a base branch cause, but at the same time could also be cinnamenu's actor hierarchy, so not sure but can test more this weekend, along with some compositing benchmarks. when returning to cinnamon without this pr applied, i can only describe it as ""much snappier"".",-1,-1,-1,0.9395874738693236,0.3462998270988464,0.9475718140602112,-1,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
