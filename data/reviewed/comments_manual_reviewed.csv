redis/redis,comments,2023386885,13157,"a quick google search will yield a lot for and against points for copyleft licenses. i am not an expert in lgpl, and don't have a lot of experience, but there are a few people above who showed examples where copyleft is problematic. also, i am not really anti gpl, i believe that in certain areas it is a fine license, like in linux kernel for example. the whole questions, is about whose freedom you are fighting for, since any restriction to maintain a certain group freedom, restrict other groups freedoms. in this specific example you are advocating for positive freedom of the free software community, but what about businesses, what about people who want to make a derivative work and monetize it in the way they see fit. i am not saying i agree with them, but why should we take their freedom away just because we disagree on something. the whole point of freedom, is that everyone has it, not just a specific group. that's why i like bsd-0 clause license, it's simple, and have pretty much no restrictions at all. since any restriction, restricts someone's freedom by the definition of the word. i was never involved with redis (other than as a user), and is not wright for me to participate in the specific decision makings of the fork, and it's community. the only reason i posted my opinions above, is that this trend as a whole worries me. where a permissive license project goes to source available, and then a fork goes completely other way to copyleft. and a broader discussion of this trend was already started above by some people.",0

redis/redis,comments,65842924,2143,"warning: big follow-up reply below! yeah, as far as i know, there aren't any other options we accept but ignore. we could just keep a list of options to ignore to loop over if we remove things in the future. that is possible, but for loading saved ziplists, they should be re-added element-by-element instead of just restored in-place. re-adding ziplists element-by-element cleans up any internal node fragmentation from users inserting/deleting elements in the middle of the quicklist and breaking the internal maximum fill levels. yeah, there are, but there are also zmalloc return value checks in other places in the redis code, so i just kept the pattern alive (e.g. adlist.c). it's written to be a generic data structure, so if people redefine zmalloc to just malloc, it should still do the right thing. at some point i'm going to make all the redis data structures a reusable external library. :) that's a new one to me. i'd prefer to leave some static signal because compilers can generate better code when they know certain functions don't leave the file, and it's made to be reusable-outside-of-redis. we could label functions as redis_static then define redis_static to nothing for redis builds. we get a lot of crash reports with no symbols anyway (packagers manually stripping the binary?). everything is made to be generic and reusable, even if redis doesn't need some of the operations. if there's a shortcut to make ltrim usage quicker, we should certainly add it. :) yeah, that's just a design decision. i left them there for redundant type checking, but we could remove them completely. difficult to say. i could see it happening either way. it probably depends on usage patterns (append-only workload with heavy reads? best memory usage). there are more optimizations we could make to reduce fragmentation (pre-allocating ziplists up to 4k or 8k), but they may not be useful for everybody. removing the number of items _is_ possible now, but for another reason. the number of _items_ is actually a really bad measurement for ziplist performance. if we set a fixed limit of 80 items and people are inserting 5 mb images into a list, that's _really_ bad. if people are inserting only integers, that's also bad because we could still store more integers in one ziplist without impacting performance. commit [a link] adds the option to use dynamic ziplist length based on total ziplist _size_ instead of a maximum length. using a maximum size gives us _optimal_ pointer overhead reduction while also giving us _optimal_ speed due to ziplist reallocations. (the slowdown in large ziplists is because of memory reallocation, so forcing ziplists to remain small gives us better bounds on ziplist performance. also see [a link] so, we could modify the option in three ways: completely remove the option and just set a global default of 4k or 8k ziplist sizes, change the option to only allow selecting 4k, 8k, or 16k ziplist sizes, or leave it as-is where we can select ziplist sizes or ziplist length. it just depends on if we think letting people tune their sizes has any benefit. (we should probably rename the option too?) setting ziplist limits based on size instead of length _also_ protects us from users inserting large elements into a ziplist and causing the ziplist to grow too big. now, if someone inserts a large element, that element gets its own ziplist assigned and no other elements will insert to that ziplist. we automatically get protected from bad performance due to big elements. very observant! the first post had no performance testing. insert/delete performance testing is at [a link] i haven't done performance testing of just reads yet, but those should be very close to the linked list version. that certainly works! [larger sidenote: we should probably end up using a slightly better workflow. we currently have `unstable -> stable`, but we really need a few more steps [[this can also help fix the ""too many redis point releases"" or ""major new features in minor version numbers"" problem if we push proper maintenance releases (2.8.18.1, 2.8.18.2, etc) versus others]]. git workflows for public projects are solved problems we don't have to re-invent. see things like [a link] — i have an entire local 'pu' branch (not public yet, but soon) that has about 40 commits from public prs waiting for official approval. we have too many proposed things that nobody gets around to testing/using, and since nobody tests or uses them, they never get approved, so it's a cycle. ""unstable"" is actually _too_ stable! :)] pluggable, key/value metadata rdb format, right? :) great to hear! it sure broke a lot while being written. most of the code tests run in a loop covering all the different edge cases for ziplist sizes too which helps a lot. yay! deleting in the middle of large lists is probably the biggest speed-up compared to linked list. oh, i hadn't even considered that. it'll help a lot with large lists in clusters during slot moving. good point. i'll look into adding it (the quicklist node count is just quicklist->len; we could also dump the individual ziplist info (byte size and element count) in debug output too). thanks for all the notes! so, what's remaining: - rdb format upgrade - save ql as series of zls - restore ql by appending zl elements (`quicklistappendvaluesfromziplist()`) - add ql-specific debug info - move existing list `list-max-ziplist-value` option to new ""ignore"" section of config parsing - maybe rename `list-max-ziplist-entries` (or remove it entirely and just set default ziplist size to 4k or 8k) - investigate if `quicklistdelrange()` can take a faster ltrim shortcut. - maybe rename static functions to redis_static and set redis_static="""" during build",1

audacity/audacity,comments,838826849,835,"there's lots of virtue signalling in the comments, unfortunately. this pr introduces a full network stack into an application that successfully managed without one for over 20 years. thus introducing one really should have a very good reason and given the expected overall quality of the collected information the data ain't the compelling reason in this matter. there are simply too many threads attached that negatively affect the quality of the collected data, thus there's much easier and worthwhile methods to produce even better statistics to base your decisions on. remains the part regarding crash reports: one of the few points that i agree. unfortunately even here you don't really need to introduce networking into the core application. to give one example: `htop` simply gives a backtrace, some basic information required for a bug report and instruction how to help to make the backtrace more informative (basically: how you call `objdump` - or its equivalent - on your platform so you can attach that file to the bug report). this gives the option for the user to opt-in sending the bug report and still manages to respect the freedom of the user to not being tracked by the application. if you want to make it more friendly for beginners you could even use a separate application that pops up just when the main application crashed (like firefox and several other tools do), but even then the main application does not need any linkage to any networking stack. and fwiw: the information that `htop` asks the user to provide usually helps to pin down the exact line of the crash within about 20 minutes, even when handling the `objdump` file by hand. could be more convenient to do, but the fact is, that the actual bug reporting can and should be fully offline.",0

qBittorrent/qBittorrent,comments,864377396,14959,"_it seems that your problem is that you never doubt that you are right, and when your opinion is questioned, you do your best to find evidence that you are right. often it comes down not to formal proofs, but simply to searching for like-minded people and quoting them, etc. if i'm right, and this is true, then let's just end this discussion and everyone will have their own opinion. (because you don't care about mine, do you?) if the above is not valid, then let's try to continue._ **i'm really trying to find proof that this is a really useful thing** (although you may not believe me). that's how i understand it. to begin with, ""copying all dependencies to the build folder on each build"" instead of ""one-time setting of environment variables"" is inherently irrational. even the fact that the actual copying does not happen every time, but only after checking the files for changes, does not cancel its irrationality. after all, doing something (quite trivial for someone who decided to build an application) once looks much more rational than doing something with each build! of course, you will object that the user have to manually set the environment variables, _which is extremely difficult, etc._, and the copying is performed by the build system behind the scene and does not bother the user. but, as i mentioned in passing above, this should not be a problem for a user who decides to build an application on his own for the purpose of testing and debugging it, otherwise his mental abilities cause great doubt that he should do this at all. and besides, it does still bother the user, if we are talking specifically about the developer, as users of the build system, who can invoke the build quite often, so even a few extra seconds that it will spend each time checking/copying dependencies can greatly irritate him. (the above gives me enough reason to make this feature at least optional and disabled by default.) let's move on... well, maybe it has some other advantage that could offset its shortcomings? we'll see... could it be this? it does ""make installation trivial"" by simply moving the execution of all non-trivial actions from the installation step to the build step! this is obviously illogical, because the build step is performed much more often than the installation step, and most of the build cases do not imply further installation (if we are talking about developers workflow). in addition, it is not clear why it is impossible to still have this non-trivial logic where it is really required (in installation procedure)? sorry, i didn't find any proof why copying runtime dependencies to a single location **exactly at the build step** makes the installation process easier. this does not apply to this topic at all. no need to abuse it. i really like the idea of an automated build, so releasing the next version would just be adding a tag to the repository. what i don't like is the way that is suggested in this pr.",-1
qBittorrent/qBittorrent,comments,403529201,9007,"if feasible, i would choose to ready the mainwindow as early as possible (modern browsers startup time is impressive!) and let user know program is still initializing: could be some text in statusbar, or display the torrent jobs initially as ""not yet loaded"" and transition to other ready state (paused or downloading) when it is loaded. i've been thinking a lot about this problem lately. and i've come to the conclusion again that those disruptions to the natural sequence of initialization of the components with that you guys are trying to solve this problem can't lead to anything good. we will only get a lot of logical errors and unmaintainable code! the sequence should be in used-using order (as i said many times before). at global it should be as the following: 1. core components 2. ui and remote access components but is right too, the qbittorrent is ""interactive program"" (in gui mode) so it would be incorrect to leave the user without a response for a long time. however, this does not mean that we must break the right order. why should we display the main window immediately if it can't do any good at this time?.. i suggest another option (similar to other long-loaded programs): we just show the splash window (with some initialization related messages) until the application is fully loaded. tray icon can also be showed but it shouldn't provide any controls during application loading.",0

qBittorrent/qBittorrent,review_comments,491709624,13288,"i'm merely telling a fact which might be something you didn't realize before. alright, but i'm noting that each reviewer has their own focus area and lax area and no one except the maintainer is except from this process, and this is how the current review process goes. i see no harm (little inconvenience at most) in adding this functionality a bit later, from my pov why not hold it for a while and see how it goes? from my pov taking resources but not putting it into use is wasteful. i think i already explained myself clear enough. each person has their own mind and thoughts, it is not always possible to see reasoning from others mind, even trying very hard. i faced similar situation numerous time when submitting prs, i believe all team members have. i've learned not to take it personal as it is merely subjective opinions on matters. i think my previous suggestions are concrete enough, i'll add here that imo it is taking too many lines that it is distracting when reading the ci script and it should be moved near to the affected actions as said before. i hope you also agree that reviewer comments (especially from team members) are not worthless. fyi, when i propose a pr, i find it useless to keep insisting my own reasoning when sufficient information is presented and the reviewer still thinks otherwise, in that case i can only trust the reviewer is knowing what he is doing. an accepted yet compromised pr is still better than a never-to-be-merged pr which contributes nothing to the project. also as you probably already know, the current employed merge process requires 2 out of 3 approvals from selected team members, i believe this is deliberately designed to collect opinions from multiple trusted minds and have tighter quality control on the pr, this also means making compromises are not unexpected and in fact, happens very often.",-1
