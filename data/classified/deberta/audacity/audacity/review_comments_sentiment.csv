(no danger in that case that the non-null pointer will become stale because of the action of other threads. all deletion of windows is done in the main thread.) 5. really it is the responsibility of `onprogress`, defined there, to guard against capturing a dangling pointer. fix it there, then simplify here, removing this intermediate level of wrapping. 6. should you do the same in the five other places that now use callafter in the *dialog.cpp files? i haven't proved yet to myself that it's necessary in all cases, but it is easy to do to enhance safety. so, do that!",0,0.9747119545936584

(let's neglect time stretching). still the request might not align to the actual blocks, because of the history of cuts and pastes causing some under-sized blocks, or because some starting point was chosen without regard to alignment. but maintaining two buffers would still reduce the number of database queries. a request for the maximum block size might be filled partly by one slot, then partly by the other, but then also the remainder of the other slot is available to satisfy the next request without again invoking the getter function. in other words -- without reproducing all complications of `sampletrackcache`, still i would rewrite the above to loop, filling alternate slots, then copying to the out buffer, until satisfying the total request.",0,0.8809841871261597
