"This previously used a Test Navigation Observer, but this no longer works for the filesystem URL following Mustafa's r554850, because a top-level filesystem URL navigation will be blocked on the renderer side. I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use Wait For Load Stop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet. However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the Execute Script that sets location above returns before we've received the Begin Navigation from the renderer. Hence this ugly extra dummy Execute Script. Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when Get Text Content() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the Begin Navigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused Get Render Frame Hosts For Extension to fail. Alternatively, I could wait for filesystem URLs to fail with a console error, similar to what Mustafa did on line 1118. Separately, in light of Mustafa's change (once we're certain that it sticks), we might want to kill the renderer if it actually sends us a Begin Navigation with a top-level filesystem URL (to handle the compromised renderer case) and add a separate test for that.",0

On the other hand a user may forget to supply or decide not to supply volume_id and in this case all hosts should pass. In this case I set filtering_result to True and use it as return value. If on the yet another hand it is set to None that means that we have a valid volume_id and are in process of filtering.

Okay this is really my lack of ability to articulate or plain stupidity. I think what i wanted to reflect was one can do a create-firewall without supplying a router_id or port_id_list. And in that case the firewall will be in a PENDING_CREATE state. The logical resource is created but has no binding to any router or ports. Once we update the resource with a router or router + list of ports - these columns will be populated. So in that sense it is not required but that only implies logical resource creation. The PENDING_CREATE state is in line with the current implementation.,0

The use case here is things like doing some background network pinging etc. User has no idea what's running. - Console apps seem to not do what you expect here -- the default behaviour will kill the console window without affecting the ""main"" process of the app - If you wanted to act on a failed attempt with a heavy handed Terminate Process, you need to block even longer or delay stuff on the event loop. We don't want to do either here. (4) Generate Console Ctrl Event. You can't control the process group this signal is sent to. It goes to *everybody* in the calling process' group. That's bad.

In the interim I'd like to look and see if there aren't other tests that could be added for the capability, but unfortunately they'd have to go through the advisory cycle first and won't really help for 2015.05(ish). I'll also note that there's a *potential* loophole should we feel the need to invoke it: the bylaw states that *vendors* may not request flagging all tests for a capability (refer to C(3)4 for the actual wording). So if, for example, the Foundation (through it's Interoperability Engineer, presumably) or perhaps folks acting on behalf of the Board (like, say, the co-chairs of the Def Core Committee, though I'll note one of them has a potential conflict of interest in this particular instance as she is employed by the same vendor) were to request it, that wouldn't violate the bylaw. In the interim: you're right. We can't accept dropping all the tests for a capability at a vendor's request, so I'm -1. Still, I'm going to look into whether there are additional tests we should be including so that they can start the advisory phase sooner rather than later.",0

"As noted below, I think you need to assert what you support here. Right now, if a user does rescue on an instance booted from volume, it looks to me like the following will happen: * root_vhd_path will return a non-existent path * self._vmutils.detach_vm_disk will silently do nothing [1] * New disk with invalid path with be added [2] This definitely won't work as the user intends. As it's unsupported at the moment that's fine, but it would be much nicer to the user to tell them that with a clear error message rather than leaving them wondering why their rescued instance doesn't work. Also, I haven't looked at the interaction with unrescue, but it's critical that the above mess can be unwound with unrescue. If it currently work it's presumably just luck :) TL;DR Not supporting everything is fine, but I think you need to explicitly check that root_vhd_path exists and there is only 1 disk. If not, you need to error out early. [1] This might be generally bad. Seems like the sort of thing you'd want to know if it didn't work. Separate issue, though.

"This will be called for every source frame. We might need to worry about sqrt, but I'd need to profile. I'll try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt. It's not much of an issue on my desktop, where the *total* cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is ~3us. It's >10us on my Pixel 1 though. That includes re-calculating a sqrt from N frames ago to subtract from the Windowed Analyzer's accumulator. So there's 6 sqrts total per source frame (3 metrics * 2 sqrts). All the sqrts currently use double precision, but I'm pretty sure single precision would be good enough. In general, after getting the basics in place, I'd like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can. If we really need to, we could use a sqrt approximation. As long as the approximation is monotonic, it should be good at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be off a bit. If we really really need to, we could also remove SMR. RMS only needs to call sqrt on a reporting event (much less often) and not when a sample is added.",0

"I have a couple of concerns here. The most minor one is that this now forces us to use this decorator only on instance or class methods; is there anywhere where this is not the case? The second concern is that, if I recall correctly, the get_context_from_function_and_args() function was created because the decorator was used on some methods where context had to be searched for, which argues that, for those methods, it is not the first non-self argument to the method. This means that, for those methods, this could result in a notify still containing the context, but missing the first argument to the method, which may be rather useful. Also, it's worth pointing out that there are no other consumers of get_context_from_function_and_args(). (It is used in nova/openstack/common/notifier/api.py, but the version used is of course from nova/openstack/common/context.py.) Given that, this patch should probably also remove the function, assuming my two concerns above aren't a factorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦",0

"HmmmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦as far as I can see, you never reset requests.request, which, IMO, is a bad thing.

I will also frequently use the decorator form of mock.patch() in this instance, e.g., something like: @mock.patch('requests.request', return_value=requests.Response()) def test_client_with_timeout(self, mock_request): Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ mock_request.return_value.status_code = 200 mock_request.return_value.headers = { Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ } instance.authenticate() mock_request.assert_called_once_with(Ã¢â‚¬Â¦)",0

You can create an ""empy"" object with a ""dummy"" name and then have the deserialize method overwrite it. >>> class A(object): ... def __init__(self, name): ... self.name = name ... def deserialize(self, o): ... self.__dict__ = o ... >>> obj = A('test') >>> obj.deserialize({'name': 'new_name'}) >>> obj.name 'new_name' >>> I understand the point behind passing the flag is to validate that either of those are set but I personally don't see a huge value in that for this specific case.

On the other hand a user may forget to supply or decide not to supply volume_id and in this case all hosts should pass. In this case I set filtering_result to True and use it as return value. If on the yet another hand it is set to None that means that we have a valid volume_id and are in process of filtering.

"Even though this solution is acceptable, it is still not clear to me the difference in behavior between this approach and raising Share Resource Not Found given the code below: If you always throw Share Resource Not Found (no if/else condition as in your code), manager will do exactly what you are doing, it will swallow the exception and proceed. If it is not ""Deleting path"", as you are checking for such in share status, it will throw exception, just as are you doing, since manager is only swallowing the exception when deleting the share. The only scenario which I think this is valid is if this library is used outside of Manila, which is what I understood based on our IRC conversation, but by using share['status'] here I am assuming it will not be used outside of Manila Manager code path. So I am still confused as why always throwing Share Resource Not Found does not achieve the same behavior as you are implementing in your driver code. Please correct me if I am missing something.",0

"I have a couple of concerns here. The most minor one is that this now forces us to use this decorator only on instance or class methods; is there anywhere where this is not the case? The second concern is that, if I recall correctly, the get_context_from_function_and_args() function was created because the decorator was used on some methods where context had to be searched for, which argues that, for those methods, it is not the first non-self argument to the method. This means that, for those methods, this could result in a notify still containing the context, but missing the first argument to the method, which may be rather useful. Also, it's worth pointing out that there are no other consumers of get_context_from_function_and_args(). (It is used in nova/openstack/common/notifier/api.py, but the version used is of course from nova/openstack/common/context.py.)

"> kill -0 basically validates the pid That's a smart way to validate a pid. I will update Makefile with kill in a separate CL. > There's another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master... maybe check the command line as well or cwd of the pid? fds etc? I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd. For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check : We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master"" In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.

If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema. Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so: 1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1 2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2 3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3 4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects. Instead you should have, a tag table tag, description, where tag is key and a mapping table tag_id, resource_type, resource_id This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky. Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies",1

Why UNPAUSING is being saved to the db if the current state is RUNNING?) 2) I think that for [UN]PAUSING we should take a different approach than this. At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that? If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here? I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""! Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again.

If they contain the same supported features, we are done. (2) If they do not, then force enrollment/sync until they contain the same supported features. In this scheme, we wouldn't need to worry about the List Values at all, since we wouldn't be storing any values in preferences. We could just extract a std::vector from both the Gcm Device Info and local device metadata. What do you think about this idea? Do you see anything that could go wrong here?",1

"I am a bit concerned about the implementation here. If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema. Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so: 1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1 2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2 3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3 4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects. Instead you should have, a tag table tag, description, where tag is key and a mapping table tag_id, resource_type, resource_id This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky. Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies",1

"General robustness nit (bit of style in particular): Don't assign to the attribute intermediate values. You mangle the hell out of boto_file throughout the following values- assign once the value has stabilized. The reasons for this style don't strictly apply here, but the style should be used regardless since it's good form; basically, if ever dealing w/ cpy initializers, threading, etc, take your pick, having intermediate assignment like this means you've got varying state that can bite you in the ass. Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an Attribute Error; etc, thus assign once stable.

"This is the ugliest extension ever made. The author of this extension should be hanged over a pool full of hungry crocodiles. Obviously I am its original author. Adding more stuff to this extension will only make the code even more unmainteinable. Personally I think external_gateway_info is one of those attributes which should be promoted to sub resource. This will simplify authz policy management, and most importantly the user workflow. We need to find a way where the main resource and the sub resource can be created/updated/returned in the same API request. However, if necessary, the user should be able to operate directly on the subresource. This is probably something that can't be addressed for this release cycle. So if there is any urgency around this blueprint we might proceed this way and then rework it in Kilo. However, if this patch does not make Juno, I would suggest reworking the external_gateway_info attribute (and yes, we should worry also about backward compatibility)",1

This may result in a crash when the application exits (but _many_ never call exit() and are simply automatically killed by the system). 2/ there *is* existing native code here that is probably buggy but just happens to work due to 1/. And some of this code is never going to be recompiled (if it were, it would be against a newer NDK, and the new code wouldn't have this problem). 3/ Your patch changes the system's behaviour for this legacy code.

So, if I rebase as your wish then your previous suggestion of splitting (for easier review) will become silly and bullshit, right??? You are not consistent in making review at all????

"I totally agree with you. IMHO neutronclient is already very different from other clients and it is something ""stupid"". Consistency across all openstack clients is a big topic and it should be discussed and improved as a whole community and it is already raised as one of important topics in dev ML discussion. Even when we have consistency across openstack clients, I believe neutronclient will be quite different from the current one. I am not sure what is the goal of this patch. If we need further discussion over all openstack client, I think it is beyond of this patch. Consistency inside neutornclient, I agree. I don't have a strong opinion on T/F vs T/t/F/f, so I am okay to keep T/F for consistency. I would like to leave the decision to the original author.

I could probably share Fuchsia's with Linux's, but it'd still need to be a template then to handle Process Reader, so it seemed less worthwhile since shoving it all in the header sort of sucks. (I also couldn't think of a name for the template... Memory Snapshot Linux Android Fuchsia isn't exactly pretty.)

"Well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug (and it is well tested). What caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that. So in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts (would contain numa_node as a key), but then we convert them to objects [1] by using Pci Device Pool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags. Upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call Pci Device Pool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it's not on the object. For filtering to work numa_node needs to match (and it's actually gone) so all requests fail. The code in [1] merged 2 months after the patch that introduces NUMA awareness of PCI devices.

"funny definition of ""shorter"". Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz"" Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version "": $ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g version Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check. If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}' of to be ""shorter"" :-) : flex -V | awk ....

"(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:). First, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear). The first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that. The second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options. I do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled. I feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay. But because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting. I hope my proze give you the explanation you want. Perhaps I should put some of it in the code as comment?",1

"These various ideas all seem to have a built in race condition; I'm not sure which idea is least likely to cause a problem. For example, if a query for cpu on one of the created servers is done before and after the upgrade, odds are that before the upgrade there will be no results because the pollster has not run. However, that's not _guaranteed_. Similarly, if a query is done for `instance` it is unlikely, but not impossible, that some data after the upgrade will come from notifications and some from polling. Therefore I need the answer to two questions: * How can I form a query that says ""only give me polling data for meter X""? * How can I form a query that says ""only give me results after the upgrade""? Is there metadata that will allow filters on that? For the sake on concision and quick resolution pretend a) that I'm an idiot b) the query docs suck.",1

Users will have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation patterns. Do you have any suggestions? I'm considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the root of the config library, so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it (e.g. we'll be able to do cfgclient.Get(..., ""services/${appid}"", ...)).

This is kind of ugly - why don't we get rid of this crap now we don't need it here anymore.

"This is the ugliest extension ever made. The author of this extension should be hanged over a pool full of hungry crocodiles. Obviously I am its original author. Adding more stuff to this extension will only make the code even more unmainteinable. Personally I think external_gateway_info is one of those attributes which should be promoted to sub resource. This will simplify authz policy management, and most importantly the user workflow. We need to find a way where the main resource and the sub resource can be created/updated/returned in the same API request. However, if necessary, the user should be able to operate directly on the subresource. This is probably something that can't be addressed for this release cycle. So if there is any urgency around this blueprint we might proceed this way and then rework it in Kilo. However, if this patch does not make Juno, I would suggest reworking the external_gateway_info attribute (and yes, we should worry also about backward compatibility)",1

"Yes. Octal number support is idiotic.

"These various ideas all seem to have a built in race condition; I'm not sure which idea is least likely to cause a problem. For example, if a query for cpu on one of the created servers is done before and after the upgrade, odds are that before the upgrade there will be no results because the pollster has not run. However, that's not _guaranteed_. Similarly, if a query is done for `instance` it is unlikely, but not impossible, that some data after the upgrade will come from notifications and some from polling. Therefore I need the answer to two questions: * How can I form a query that says ""only give me polling data for meter X""? * How can I form a query that says ""only give me results after the upgrade""? Is there metadata that will allow filters on that? For the sake on concision and quick resolution pretend a) that I'm an idiot b) the query docs suck.",1
"2 things: 1) Is it possible to UNPAUSE a machine which is RUNNING!? (I would think that you can only UNPAUSE something that is PAUSED, hidden bug? Why UNPAUSING is being saved to the db if the current state is RUNNING?) 2) I think that for [UN]PAUSING we should take a different approach than this. At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that? If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here? I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""! Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again. (And sorry if someone already suggested that, I haven't looked in all previous patch-sets to see if that's the case)",1

"i misunderstood what you were asking. (there are too damn many different kinds of macros, all with very similar names!) i thought you were asking about macros like _POSIX_ADVISORY_INFO which must always be defined, but whose value tells you whether their feature is supported. obviously these ones need to be defined. but now i guess you were actually talking about ones like _POSIX_SS_REPL_MAX which should _not_ be defined if you don't have the optional feature it belongs to. obviously these ones need to _not_ be defined. as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in , it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them. (though, as you say, in this case at least they let us set it to -1.) if glibc doesn't have a macro, that probably means we don't need to either (and also probably means we _shouldn't_ have it --- i can't think of any part of POSIX we support that they don't).",1

I think the ""right"" solution is to remove the unique constraint on name and flavorid in Instance Types and do checking in the create code to make sure you aren't creating a duplicate.
