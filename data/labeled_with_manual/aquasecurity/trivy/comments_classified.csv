aquasecurity/trivy,comments,1836384364,5635,"i pushed a cyclonedx test as well. there are a few problems with it that will require changing its marshaller: 1) there is a problem with the cyclonedx dependencies format. only package urls are used, so in the case of a shadowed dep, you don't know which `b` package is being referenced since there are two `pkg:julia/b.9.0`. are we required to use purls or can we use another format? spdx uses an arbitrary hash here and that works well. 2) i noticed this comment: [a link] indeed this is the case as you can see in my (failing) cyclonedx test. can this functionality be changed, or will that not conform to the cyclonedx specification? if we can't change it, julia users should simply not use cyclonedx. 3) (applicable to spdx as well) i have a concern about the hasher used in production, given that we use a custom hasher in tests. should we update the default hasher rather than providing a custom one in our tests? if not, how do we know a proper hasher implementation (i.e. one which does not discard shadowed packages) will be used in production? i guess if we really needed to, we could also change the julia purl spec as [a link] has not been accepted yet. the purls could become `pkg:uuid` e.g. `pkg:edca9bc6-334e-11e9-3554-9595dbb4349c.9.0`.",0,0,0,0.8805878758430481,0.9881590604782104,0.9816464781761168,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2562233897,8177,"proposal: address this enhancement in a separate pr to keep the current changes focused i agree with you. i think we need to discuss this. initially (i may be wrong) trivy was crippled by aggregating individual packages to avoid having too many tables in a report. after adding summary table, we can consider removing the logic for aggregating packages entirely. this will simplify the code more and avoid difficulties when converting reports between formats. this pr maintains the current separation to keep the implementation straightforward it seems that having multiple types for a single file is rare, so i suggest using this logic and waiting for feedback from users. i prefer this way. i also have one idea - some users don't need to see vulnerability/misconfiguration numbers (cve etc). so we can hide other tables by default and show them only when using a new flag (`--show-report-tables` or something like that). or vice versa hide them by flag if users only need summary numbers. but i think we need to ask users about it. ____ as a future update: - what if we check the enabled scanners and show only the required columns? eg by default the summary table will only include the vulnerability and secret columns. or for `misconfig` mode only the `misconfigutation` column.",0,0,0,0.8713299632072449,0.7157208919525146,0.8221772909164429,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2572403871,8177,"i actually considered reusing the k8s summary table, but ultimately decided to keep them separate for several reasons: first, as pointed out, the k8s summary table contains much information. this isn't necessarily a negative aspect - it's designed this way because k8s doesn't display details in the summary table by default (requires `--report all` flag for detailed view). however, the approach is different for image and filesystem scans: we show a simple summary table first, followed by detailed result tables. therefore, i believe the summary table should be kept as simple as possible. this represents a slightly different purpose from the k8s use case. second, since we plan to make a separate plugin for the k8s cluster scan similar to [a link], i wanted to avoid core dependencies on k8s. if we were to share code, having the dependency direction flow from k8s to core would be preferable, not the other way around. however, given the different purposes mentioned above, whether we should standardize these tables at all requires further discussion. yes, that's correct. i made this distinction because we frequently receive user feedback asking to clarify whether something wasn't scanned at all or was scanned but returned zero findings. i'll add a note beneath the table to clarify this distinction.",0,0,0,0.9187855124473572,0.9792942404747008,0.8982952237129211,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,1698604879,5062,there are two ways: 1. use the local database - build trivy db locally and move it to the cache directory (see the default value of `--cache-dir`) - note that metadata.json must be located next to the database as trivy tries to download the latest database if the last updated at is old 2. use your own repository - build trivy db and push it to your repository (e.g. ghcr.io/juan131/trivy-db) - pass the repository with `--db-repository`,0,0,0,0.9820687174797058,0.9945898056030272,0.9946609139442444,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2343777574,7339,"rego is a syntax that a lot of engineers are not familiar with. we are intending to drop this into dozens and dozens of repositories and asking 50-75 engineers to use it. adding lines to a config file is a far smaller learning curve than adding in/maintaining rego, project to project, engineer to engineer. by not having line configurations in an ignore file, you're actually producing false findings by ignoring entire rulesets for an entire scan, when it should be more explicit (or at least allow that level of granularity). specifically, for helm template configuration checks example; it could have two deployment manifests, one that has privileged containers and one that does not. not having a line enforcement on the ignore file would ignore that rule across both entirely when it should not, and allow privileged containers where it was not intended on a configuration check.",0,0,0,0.8630788922309875,0.8005957007408142,0.8732564449310303,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2344885970,7339,"i do not think rego solves my issue. rego is inherently hard to get engineers to learn, especially those who do not work with it regularly. it would be difficult to scale to some of our needs. for example, one chart has 200 ignore rules in the ignore file that we run, when using the granular control. this is a cncf oss chart and not our own. doing that in rego would be unwieldly and unfriendly to those not familiar with rego itself. that is one chart out of the 40-50 we're pushing. the config file approach is in line with other linters (which is essentially what the misconf is for us, here, for helm templating). it is important to us to try to avoid additional cognitive load on engineers, and staying to the same pattern of maintaining config that is the standard across most tools in the space is ideal. already managing linters for go, python, terraform, markdown, etc, it is a pattern that has no learning curve. i also think the ignorefile concept for misconf is inherently broken without the use of explicit lines. so, it is not so much a feature as it is a potential bugfix. for example; running the misconf scan against a template that has clusterroles. ksv048 flags over privileged cluster roles, however there is a need for the crud verbs on one of the admin roles. by simply adding ksv048 to the ignore file, it is now essentially disabling that rule for the admin role and other possibly read-only roles in the same file. this is a security risk. by stating we only want to ignore ksv048 for lines 9-14, it will still be enforced on the read-only clusterrole. we could split this into separate files for this scenario, however we have seen this same pattern a lot in upstream oss components and we try to avoid manipulating those and deviating from upstream. i realize the yaml ignorefile is experimental, but it is something we would like to use. the other alternative would be creating a rego wrapper and loading the yaml config ourselves and parsing it in rego, which i would like to avoid doing.",-1,-1,0,0.9305213689804076,0.9167792201042176,0.5654182434082031,-1.0,accept,majority_agreement,2

[code block] [code block] what is the difference for you? debugging rego can be difficult if it does not work as expected, but so is yaml. without reading the source code, it is impossible to understand how `.trivyignore.yaml` is processed. like said, i am not opposed to adding the feature if there is a good reason. i'm just trying to understand what is preventing you from using rego.",0,-1,0,0.9250415563583374,0.5245009064674377,0.95744788646698,0.0,accept,majority_agreement,2
aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2346103531,7339,"it is managing code versus managing config. code has significantly more overhead with it in regards to tlm. it is also quite a bit more verbose and more prone to error. for a one off scenario, i agree the rego approach is fine. at scale and longevity is where issues may start popping up. opa v1 changes are an example here; this does not fit that syntax and would break when required/moved to it. also, if causemetadata or any part of that struct changes, all of the rego now becomes invalidated. one chart out of the many we work with has over 200 entries for an ignore file. id, start_line, end_line, statement. that is 800 lines, which is a lot in it's own right. however, moving that to rego now becomes 1200 lines (adding the lines for the ignore block and the spaces before/after). sure, we could write more advanced rego to eliminate duplication of ignore blocks per id and handle the sets of lines, but that gets back into managing and requiring engineers now to understand sets/comprehension etc in rego. let's now take that number and multiple it times the amount of charts we're managing of 40-50, and you see how quickly that becomes unmanageable. now, not every repo has 200 entries, but lets use that number and extrapolate... thats 48k lines of rego that now have to be managed. should a change to causemetadata struct happen, or the flip to opav1 syntax, a config file is abstracted away from those changes and would not require any uplift. the rego approach would require alterations to 48k lines of uplift.",0,0,0,0.8644335865974426,0.9260402917861938,0.930147647857666,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2
aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2346282122,7339,"this sounds like the opposite argument to me. as the operation scales, yaml becomes inadequate, and more flexible filtering is needed. this is actually what we have seen over the years. a comparison with regard to the line number would help the transition to rego more, although i don't think it is meaningful. as you also mentioned, rules can be written in short as follows. [code block] if there are 200 rules, yaml will result in 800 lines, whereas rego will only require 210 lines. if there are 50 repositories, with yaml it is 40k lines, but with rego it is about 10k lines. however, again, a comparison of line numbers doesn't make sense to me. opa v1 changes make sense, but it can also happen in trivy's ignorefile. as you probably know, trivy used to have `.trivyignore`, but needed to introduce `.trivyignore.yaml` for more flexibility. furthermore, `.trivyignore.yaml` is still an experimental feature that is subject to breaking changes. we try to minimize such change, but sometimes it is unavoidable. it may not be correct to assume that a change in `.trivyignore.yaml` is less disruptive than one in rego. i assume that opa is not yet stable as it is below v1, which is why breaking changes will be made at the time of becoming v1, but it is expected to be stable after reaching v1. also, for migration to the new syntax, [migration methods are supported]([a link] ) at language level, such as `opa fmt --refactor-local-variables`. if changes are made to `.trivyignore.yaml`, it is difficult to provide such functionality. in conclusion, our policy is to recommend rego for more advanced filtering and implement it in `.trivyignore.yaml` for the basic filtering that most people need. otherwise, we end up implementing very complex logic in `.trivyignore.yaml`. should know more about how much need there is, so i'd defer to him.",0,0,0,0.7834774851799011,0.9689833521842957,0.9439154863357544,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2402071835,7664,"i'll try to summarize my feedback into 3 points: ## 1 - main login command should be reserved for main api login when we say `trivy auth login` it's not very clear what the purpose of this login is for. `docker login`, `gh auth login`, `snyk auth`, `aws sso login` and every other cli tool with a login command will sign me into the main service that the cli is representing, and allow me to interact with the service via the cli. so as a normal user might expect that `trivy auth login` will allow me to sign into the trivy service - maybe this is trivy server mode, maybe this is aqua, maybe this is the future version of trivy server/aqua, but either way, i'm not sure it's expected that the main login command will authenticate me to an arbitrary container registry. ## 2 - registry login is not the only kind of auth we support flows based on container registry: 1. pulling image to scan 1. pulling a trivy asset from registry (except vex-db): trivy-db/trivy-java-db/trivy-checks 1. installing wasm modules from registry flows not based on container registry: 1. scanning other targets: all are authenticated ourside of trivy 1. private repos - github/gitlab token in env vars 2. k8s clusters - kubeconfig 3. ami - aws sdk env vars 4. tf modules - tf sdk env vars 1. vex repository: http auth, or implementation specific auth 1. trivy client/server mode: dedicated `--token` flag ## 3 - several registry authentication options if i understand correctly, this command (or docker login) will cover all of the registry based flows listed abobe. it appears that if the artifact is hosted in aws/azure/gcp registry, docker login (or this command) will not suffice, and cloud-specific authentication will be required (please correct me if wrong). also, we currently aupport dedicated `--username`/`--password` flags for basic authentication registries.",0,0,0,0.7822604775428772,0.9744892120361328,0.9733374118804932,0.0,accept,unanimous_agreement,2

aquasecurity/trivy,comments,2404772416,7664,"yes it does excuse me for thinking out loud for a bit: we have a number of other similar commands for managing connection to external registries: ` trivy module`, `trivy plugin` and `trivy vex`. today these commands don't mange authentication to the respective registries (maybe in the future they will?) but i suspect that if they did, it would be under that subcommand and not under the `auth` subcommand. these commands are grouped as ""management commands"". based on this ux that we've evolved into, managing registry connections would have to be under: `trivy registry` subcommand (which is also under management commands), i.e `trivy registry login` or `trivy registry add`). the problem with this approach is that it might be confusing with registry scanning (which we don't support today). perhaps a better solution in hindsight would have been to move all those administrative commands under a subcommand `trivy admin` (not unlike the proposed `trivy auth`) including `clean`, `module`, `plugin`, `vex`, etc. that would remove any ambiguity and allow us to grow admin commands freely. but coming back to reality, i guess `trivy auth registry login` is fine, and `trivy registry login` as well. i'd vote for the latter i think.",0,-1,0,0.8886964321136475,0.8075166940689087,0.9167658090591432,0.0,accept,majority_agreement,2
