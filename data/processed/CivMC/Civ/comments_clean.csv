2183350524,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-21T19:41:41Z,"as a semi-related side note, i have 1.21 working [a link] and will create a pr for it once paper marks 1.21 as stable."
2183356345,550,Protonull,2024-06-21T19:45:12Z,"question, why gradle 8.5 instead of 8.8?"
2183358451,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-21T19:47:05Z,i think because it was complaining that 8.5 was the minimum viable version so that's what i went with.
2187634388,550,Protonull,2024-06-24T23:38:18Z,might be worth going through and undoing the formatting though as this is an extremely contentful pr and it's hard to review the pr.
2187867710,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-25T03:07:24Z,"managed to get rid of a lot of it, will keep at it. intellij is remarkably frustrating to deal with regarding this, i can't seem to find a way to completely disable every autoformatter that it's using."
2187872423,550,Protonull,2024-06-25T03:11:24Z,"hmmm, try going to `settings -> tools -> actions on save` and basically unticking everything. you don't really want these things to happen unless it's your own project anyway, or the project's style is *strictly* enforced, otherwise you'll just get diff-hell :p"
2187888488,550,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-25T03:16:01Z,never had any of them checked. i think it's that all the plugins have different styles and intellij isn't sure what to stick to. mostly it's that they use spaces vs. tabs for indentation or have different rules about line wrapping and whatnot. even forcing it to not format .java files still has it make some changes for some reason (eg removing indents on empty lines is apparently not formatting).
2239317791,550,AngrySoundTech,2024-07-19T14:32:01Z,"worth noting that github has an ""ignore whitespace changes"" in the review menu if you're not already aware"

2014089671,383,okx-code,2024-03-22T00:13:50Z,you can use `namedtextcolor.red` instead of an rgb colour. it can also be provided as an argument in `component.text`

2014102503,383,okx-code,2024-03-22T00:29:22Z,could you do the confirmation without an underscore?
2014483518,383,drekamor,2024-03-22T07:10:23Z,sure. i just wasn't sure whether the command uses greedy string or normal string arguments. i'll look into it
2015550690,383,drekamor,2024-03-22T17:19:04Z,-code i removed underscores from the message but i'm not sure whether the command takes a normal string argument or a greedy string
2015552295,383,okx-code,2024-03-22T17:19:53Z,have you tested it?
2015559610,383,drekamor,2024-03-22T17:24:16Z,"not yet, need to build the plugin"

2015993446,383,awoo-civ,2024-03-22T21:57:16Z,"hmm, perhaps `/nldg confirm deletion` should be enclosed in quotes, i.e. `type '/nldg confirm deletion test' within 15 seconds.` should help disambiguate between the string that is to be typed and the rest of the sentence."
2015994805,383,drekamor,2024-03-22T21:58:56Z,was thinking about that as well. i'll add them
2015996777,383,MrJeremyFisher,2024-03-22T22:01:15Z,imo the message shouldn't mention snitches and bastions as citadel doesn't need to be run with bastion and jukealert and it won't necessarily be on other servers.
2016003237,383,awoo-civ,2024-03-22T22:08:21Z,"that's up to the admins i suppose, but personally i'm vehemently against supporting anything other than the needs of civmc if it requires *any* sacrifices."
1962212294,319,RedDevel2,2024-02-24T01:56:32Z,"on testing it now never shows banned players in /ep showall the button to switch, always says ""currently turned on"" no matter if you switch it. likewise the chat message always says ""banned pearls toggled off"" whenever you click the switch. also the /ep showall command now itself has a cooldown? i doubt that's supposed to be a thing."
1962217234,319,MrJeremyFisher,2024-02-24T02:12:41Z,i think the logic for the pearl toggle is backwards
1962270492,319,okx-code,2024-02-24T06:08:34Z,should be fixed now
1962341337,319,walkersgaming,2024-02-24T12:06:56Z,"i'm not sure that should've been changed, as the variable hadn't been updated with the toggle change, hence it was inverted"

2546894931,564,MrJeremyFisher,2024-12-16T21:51:13Z,"resolved, i think."
2585327826,564,okx-code,2025-01-11T16:37:31Z,this only seems to work the second time i get on a horse. the first time it's still at half a heart.
2585327984,564,okx-code,2025-01-11T16:38:01Z,you're also using this.hideitemmeta instead of this.hidehealth
2585336054,564,MrJeremyFisher,2025-01-11T16:56:50Z,are you on protocollib 5.2.0?
2585339675,564,okx-code,2025-01-11T16:57:49Z,"no, i'm on protocollib 5.3.0-snapshot-732"
2586069781,564,MrJeremyFisher,2025-01-13T02:34:10Z,"ok, 5.3.0 doesn't officially support 1.21.3. not sure what live is running but it should be on 5.4.0 for this and the other parts of attrhider to work correctly. i bumped the dependency to 5.3.0 because 5.4.0 isn't yet available on [a link] but everything works fine as long as you run 5.4.0. will fix merge conflicts in a sec"
2586075122,564,MrJeremyFisher,2025-01-13T02:42:23Z,"wow, oops, not sure how i did that"
2070728205,397,MrJeremyFisher,2024-04-22T19:18:48Z,this also fixes the protection not applying to things like stripping copper as that doesn't fire the `blockbreakevent`.

2452617936,397,okx-code,2024-11-01T21:30:12Z,you didn't respond to the review comments for two weeks
2452619894,397,MrJeremyFisher,2024-11-01T21:31:51Z,"you didn't respond to the pr for 7 months. please give me at least that long, i don't have the time for civ dev right now."
2452620756,397,okx-code,2024-11-01T21:32:41Z,feel free to open a new pr when you're ready
2452661469,397,drekamor,2024-11-01T22:15:42Z,that's just mean
2452674428,397,Protonull,2024-11-01T22:31:57Z,"yup, the expectation is always on the other. they can ghost you for 7 months, but you not pushing a requested commit within a fortnight? closed. bye. try again."
2452675679,397,okx-code,2024-11-01T22:33:39Z,"it just helps me keep the prs organised, closing the pr takes it off the list"
2453009122,397,Diet-Cola,2024-11-02T14:31:50Z,doesnt only checking the item in the players hand defeat the purpose of this pr?
2453009685,397,okx-code,2024-11-02T14:33:54Z,"either way this pr still looks at the item in the player's hand to see the damage, even if that's not the item actually damaged. i think we don't need to increase the scope of tool protection to armour items anyway, since the haste effect no longer makes sense."

2673375113,750,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:21:40Z,this pr doesn't fix the issue.
2673438675,750,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T04:50:08Z,is this because of your issue with the knockback thing or does it just not work for you? it works fine for me. a little bit jankier when it doesn't include the changes in #680 but it does correctly apply damage.
2673439931,750,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:51:03Z,"yes, the knockback needs to work as well. the issue is not fixed if another issue is introduced."
2673440807,750,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T04:51:54Z,ok. i can fix that i think.
2673441930,750,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:52:46Z,"paper already fixes this in 1.21.3 anyway, i'd rather we updated to that."
2673446574,750,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T04:56:40Z,are we not already on 1.21.3?
2673447306,750,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:57:19Z,"ah yeah we are, but the knockback issue remains"
2673449280,750,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:58:25Z,see [a link]
2673452687,750,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T05:01:10Z,hm. i kind of doubt any paper changes here would necessarily help us as we completely override the vanilla (or paper) method that handles this. i'll take a better look at it and the knockback issue when i have the time.
2617261723,746,Protonull,2025-01-28T00:33:13Z,immediate concerns here are: - are you absolutely certain there'll always be >1 array elements when split? - ~~how will this effect commands like `/nlcreategroup`? will group names be lowercased?~~
2617266418,746,MrJeremyFisher,2025-01-28T00:37:42Z,thanks. i may be stupid. commands with arguments are fine as that's the purpose of the split.
2633271930,746,Diet-Cola,2025-02-04T09:00:22Z,only long term concern with this is how future civ servers will 100% not realise this is a thing
2634069155,746,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-04T14:04:42Z,i think that's par for the course for much of sah
2634523576,746,Protonull,2025-02-04T16:46:52Z,"honestly, i'm surprised this isn't an option somewhere in minecraft/bukkit/spigot/paper"
2673389351,746,okx-code,2025-02-21T04:32:14Z,"i don't think we should be rewriting how commands work like this. if mojang changed it, let it be"
2673488149,746,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T05:18:18Z,i agree but consider that it'd be nice to have and we already override a bunch of mojang changes
2190295825,552,Protonull,2024-06-26T00:37:17Z,"it's only ""not actually necessary"" because the tests that need it have been commented out. if you uncomment them, you'll see why it's necessary, but pseudoserver actually needs to be updated, which is why drafted #393."
2190297435,552,Protonull,2024-06-26T00:38:44Z,perhaps a better solution would be moving it over to the test source set. it's otherwise just taking up space in the production jar when nothing other than the [commented out] tests need it.
2190299936,552,okx-code,2024-06-26T00:41:27Z,i'm not extending internal bukkit classes
2190301896,552,okx-code,2024-06-26T00:44:07Z,fakeplayer from hiddenore also needs to go but it's a mess to keep it while also keeping cave ore generation a thing
2190316288,552,Protonull,2024-06-26T00:59:23Z,"yeah, pseudoserver has the minestom approach [a link], this is *far* less of an issue."
2190321696,552,okx-code,2024-06-26T01:05:15Z,mockbukkit btw
2190323343,552,Protonull,2024-06-26T01:06:47Z,"btw, mockbukkit != craftbukkit"
2251866756,552,Protonull,2024-07-26T02:53:23Z,"if you intend to go through with this, you should probably remove junit and the test source set altogether too. we simply do not have well any enough managed or organised projects for it, and the stuff we need to test for, like item matching, requires a minimum level of server bootstrapping. it would probably be better to move any test stuff to `civmodcore-test` with a custom run command that starts a short-lived server instead."
1965978787,334,Protonull,2024-02-27T07:59:42Z,"while it's not really necessary, it might be worth using [a link] instead of persistentdatatype.integer. the code will be a little longer but will be more readable and will require less storage (though is a micro-optimisation)."
1966454622,334,MrJeremyFisher,2024-02-27T12:38:02Z,"ah, thanks. i was unaware that cmc had that."
1966871825,334,MrJeremyFisher,2024-02-27T15:51:59Z,"the natural spawn reason is called when the server loads an entity and when an entity is spawned, so no."
1966875220,334,okx-code,2024-02-27T15:53:22Z,"ok, what about [a link]?"
1967104754,334,MrJeremyFisher,2024-02-27T16:53:35Z,"because the horse is spawned every time the riding player logs out and back in, its age at that instant is 0. at least that's what i saw when i tried that as an option"

2130768062,398,Protonull,2024-05-25T04:57:54Z,"after the most recent commits, compacted items no longer contain the ""compacted item"" lore. that lore is instead added just prior to the item being sent over the network. this doesn't contaminate the original item, see screenshot of using `/debugging rawheld`: ![a link]"
2131418838,398,okx-code,2024-05-25T20:02:17Z,"i like the way you've approached this, it makes it look like compacted items should've always been done this way. i'll give it a proper review when i have the time."
2131423477,398,Protonull,2024-05-25T20:08:10Z,"thanks :) i've just noticed a few little things to clean up like [a link] and [a link], but other than that it *should* be good to go, pending some verification testing."
2133601118,398,Protonull,2024-05-27T14:29:35Z,"just tested this with factorymod. i used `/fmtest give recipe ingredients adv_xp_1` to give me all the inputs that xp 1 of the advanced cauldron and ran it, and it successfully produced 2 compacted emerald blocks. i then ran those through a decompactor and got 2 stacks of emerald blocks."
2134441766,398,Protonull,2024-05-28T06:30:31Z,just realised that this'll need to include a new itemexchange rule modifier since items wont have the lore anymore to match against.
2135259375,398,walkersgaming,2024-05-28T13:45:42Z,will this also affect wordbank recipes that use compacted items?
2135563857,398,Protonull,2024-05-28T15:39:09Z,"yeah, it probably would as it changes the hash of the item, though keep in mind that the 1.20.5 update will *probably* break most, if not all wordbank recipes, for the same reason."
2466810093,656,okx-code,2024-11-10T17:02:52Z,"does 1 health = 1 essence? if so we should show it as ""essence:"" rather than ""health:"""

2466811179,656,AngrySoundTech,2024-11-10T17:06:13Z,"not currently. right now, one essence repairs 12 health, and 24 health is consumed per day (one every hour). as the pearl ages, essence repairs less and less health during crafting. moving that part to when the fuel is consumed instead of refueled is part of my next goal of uncapping pearl health."
2466811783,656,awoo-civ,2024-11-10T17:07:44Z,oh! that is extremely confusing then. i don't see how it's possible for a player to figure out what they're supposed to do given the tooltip as-is.
2466812485,656,AngrySoundTech,2024-11-10T17:09:57Z,"1. i agree, i'll move that in this pr. 2. days remaining is planned in a follow-up pr 3. it's strange yes, but that's math works with the cost multiplier."
2466817281,656,AngrySoundTech,2024-11-10T17:26:06Z,"health moved above cost, days left will be there too in that grouping. ![a link]"
1958145359,275,RedDevel2,2024-02-21T22:27:04Z,now that i think about it. the name is probably why itemexchange didn't recognize it. :skull:
1958146765,275,okx-code,2024-02-21T22:27:34Z,yep it broke for me as well
1958185405,275,Protonull,2024-02-21T22:40:21Z,"that could be the cause of some unintended plugin-load ordering, but it should not cause the error. jukealert is supposed to be a soft-dependency; itemexchange is suppose to work even if jukealert isn't there. the error is also completely baffling, it's a `noclassdeffounderror`, which means a class is being used in a non-reflective manner (eg: an instance is being constructed with `new`), but the class isn't present. the missing class is `loggableaction`, right?. that by itself is bizarre because nothing in itemexchange references `loggableaction`: the class `shoppurchaseaction` extends `loggableplayeraction` and *that* implements `loggableaction`, so... why is the missing class `loggableaction` and not `loggableplayeraction`? those are both jukealert classes. also, `shoppurchaseaction` is only interacted with in two places: 1. inside a lambda that's registered as an action-factory to jukealert, something that only happens if jukealert is enabled. 2. inside an event listener that's only registered if jukealert is enabled. so how in the hell is this class being used?!"
1958263617,275,Protonull,2024-02-21T23:06:31Z,"ohhhh, okay, just figured out what's happening: the action-factory lambda gets hoisted by javac into a sibling method: ![a link] so when the class is evaluated, it finds the method and tries to evaluate its return type, loggableaction, which isn't loaded. the only fix to this is to deliberately avoid the lambda-isation and turn it into a sibling class."
2452610047,654,okx-code,2024-11-01T21:22:45Z,could we disable canstorageteleport instead?
2452660824,654,drekamor,2024-11-01T22:14:55Z,i don't know why we have it so i've made a solution that wouldn't affect it in any way :man_shrugging:
2452662308,654,okx-code,2024-11-01T22:16:37Z,it should be safe to removed based on the commit history [a link]
2452676179,654,drekamor,2024-11-01T22:34:20Z,"well, then you can do that. discovering the cause of the bug was the hard part here. took 5 minutes to write that code anyway"
2452676714,654,okx-code,2024-11-01T22:35:03Z,alright
2452676940,654,okx-code,2024-11-01T22:35:20Z,thanks for pointing us in the right direction
1949587049,2,RedDevel2,2024-02-17T01:49:10Z,really? then why is there an interval time in the config?
1949587916,2,okx-code,2024-02-17T01:51:47Z,"oh it's just the inital delay, not the interval. still weird but ok i guess"
2111337561,2,Protonull,2024-05-14T23:47:05Z,is there anything in particular preventing this from being merged since it's missed two assigned milestones?

2111278384,538,Protonull,2024-05-14T22:51:45Z,"question, to what extent, if at all, do ancient snitch logs (logs older than 30 days) play into this?"
2111280804,538,okx-code,2024-05-14T22:52:49Z,"i don't think snitch log creation time would have any impact on the query planner. perhaps insertion order could, but i doubt it."
2113586957,538,AngrySoundTech,2024-05-15T22:27:23Z,"code looks good and logic is sound, moved to ready for testing although testing may be somewhat difficult."
2113588325,538,okx-code,2024-05-15T22:28:49Z,i've been able to manually test this by querying the bugged snitches directly with the old and new statements. not on the server itself but it should be good enough to deploy straight to production

2673451420,745,okx-code,2025-02-21T05:00:18Z,safe ore break exists so that you can be el cheapo and use a non-silk pickaxe for vein mining because factorymod requires ores. it's not there to stop you accidentally mining bookshelves or whatever
2673454329,745,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T05:02:15Z,"i'd agree except bookshelves (and sea lanterns, and glowstone) are already included in the config on live."

2673459747,745,MrJeremyFisher,2025-02-21T05:06:11Z,then why not let people just add whatever they want? that way you don't have to think about the horrors of people adding glass or whatever

1962145719,257,Protonull,2024-02-23T23:50:56Z,being able to code in kotlin?
1962146387,257,okx-code,2024-02-23T23:52:13Z,what specifically do you want to use this for?
1962148024,257,AngrySoundTech,2024-02-23T23:55:27Z,"this should be added with something that uses it, not on it's own"
1962282437,257,Protonull,2024-02-24T07:11:36Z,"1. for when kira gets added. 2. while i know there was a discussion about not mixing java and kotlin within the same plugin, i nonetheless think converting the `nbttagcompoundextensions` class (and its ilk) over to kotlin's extension methods is the only sensible option. very little will change from java's perspective, but it'll be all the better for any plugin that has kotlin code and needs to use those utilities. 3. i wanna refactor itemexchange into kotlin :) i know this is kind of a meme, but if we can't mix java and kotlin within the same plugin, and refactoring a plugin into kotlin is a meme, then is kotlin support only being added for kira and that's it?"
1974189037,351,MrJeremyFisher,2024-03-02T01:53:29Z,"yeah, i tried some testing on a large area of grass & dirt and didn't see too much performance impact. unsure how it would perform on live though obviously"

2593963692,729,okx-code,2025-01-15T21:22:44Z,"no, we can make simulation distance of 3 work. changing it to 4 would also increase the number of loaded chunks a lot and therefore lag."
2593965506,729,RedDevel2,2025-01-15T21:23:49Z,3 it is then.
2585311437,713,okx-code,2025-01-11T15:58:44Z,can we simplify the copper workshop creation recipe in the same way? requiring people to manually oxidise copper doesn't quite work the same now that it can be done with rails

2571710170,676,MrJeremyFisher,2025-01-05T18:19:34Z,moved to #680
2189591073,547,MrJeremyFisher,2024-06-25T17:40:58Z,the underlying issue here is resolved by 1.20.6 as far as i can tell so this shouldn't be necessary anymore.
2212526707,547,ZeroQLi,2024-07-07T18:08:24Z,so the plan to fix this is now to update to 1.20.6?
2212528297,547,MrJeremyFisher,2024-07-07T18:14:01Z,"yeah, though i'm not sure how 1.20.6 will handle items that were created before the update. hoping any issues regarding that will crop up in testing so i can fix them before they happen on live."
