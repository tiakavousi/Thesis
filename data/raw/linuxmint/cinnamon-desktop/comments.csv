360716380,98,clefebvre,2018-01-26T08:33:25Z,"Hi @Salamandar,

This is really interesting for us, Meson looks really cool.

Could you do the following in this PR:

- Rebase the PR (it will result in having .circleci in your branch and trigger a CI build so we can check it builds everywhere).
- Add the ""files"" directory as is... right now you're listing the one file by naming it, our projects use ""files"" dirs which have to be installed as is. You can use install_dir in Meson if I'm not mistaken.
- Modify the debian/ packaging, disconnect it from autoconf and connect it to Meson. We build (and so does CI) with dpkg-buildpackage, for the build to use Meson, we need dpkg-buildpackage to call the appropriate meson and ninja commands.
"
360730793,98,Salamandar,2018-01-26T09:36:13Z,Hi ! I'm working on it. I did not touch cinnamon-desktop in a while and I've had a lot of experience with Meson since then… So a bit of refactoring is needed. I'll push when all done.
360760542,98,Salamandar,2018-01-26T11:25:20Z,"> You can use install_dir in Meson if I'm not mistaken.

At the time, install_dir would remove all the target directory content. It no longer does that so yes, I can use it.

EDIT : That's highly prefix-dependent. The default prefix is `/usr/local`, so the files directory does not correspond. I'll install each subdir of usr independently."
360773478,98,Salamandar,2018-01-26T12:34:19Z,"> disconnect it from autoconf and connect it to Meson

Do you mean to completely forget about Autotools ? I was keeping the ac/am files for now, but if that's your plan, i'll just remove all autotools files from the repo."
360792207,98,Salamandar,2018-01-26T14:01:48Z,"The debian buildsystem now uses meson, but that installs gir files into `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` instead of just `/usr/lib`.
I'll investigate this further."

The --with-pnp-ids-path option is used to specify the path to pnp.ids

```
--with-pnp-ids-path     Specify the path to pnp.ids [default=(internal)]

 As the internal file is garbage it should be possible to set it to use hwdata package

```
rpm -qf /usr/share/hwdata/pnp.ids

If you build this without introspection, I don't know if Cinnamon will even work at all, but if it does, many important parts of it will definitely break (ie. calendar, sound, keybindings, to name a few). Also, if you don't have gobject introspection in general, that breaks pretty much everything."

564500880,141,clefebvre,2019-12-11T11:33:35Z,"The bug is valid, but there's two issues in the PR:

- We should always use dgettext.. and never return format_string.. that's the actual bug.
- dcgettext can't be used, it fetches the translation from /usr/share/locale/$LANGUAGE/LC_TIME/cinnamon.mo... what we want is the opposite, we want /usr/share/locale/$LC_TIME/LC_MESSAGES/cinnamon.mo.
